AGE RELATED MUSCULAR DEGENERATION,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that can blur your central vision. It happens when aging causes damage to the macula ' the part of the eye that controls sharp, straight-ahead vision. The macula is part of the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). it's a leading cause of vision loss for older adults. AMD doesn't cause complete blindness, but losing your central vision can make it harder to see faces, read, drive, or do close-up work like cooking or fixing things around the house. Most people with AMD have dry AMD (also called atrophic AMD). This is when the macula gets thinner with age. Dry AMD happens in 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late. It usually progresses slowly over several years. There's no treatment for late dry AMD, but you can find ways to make the most of your remaining vision. And if you have late dry AMD in only 1 eye, you can take steps to protect your other eye. Wet AMD (also called advanced neovascular AMD), is a less common type of late AMD that usually causes faster vision loss. Any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD ' but wet AMD is always late stage. It happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye and damage the macula. The good news is that treatment options are available for wet AMD."
AGE RELATED MUSCULAR DEGENERATION,"Early dry AMD doesn't cause any symptoms. In intermediate dry AMD, some people still have no symptoms. Others may notice mild symptoms, like mild blurriness in their central vision or trouble seeing in low lighting. In late AMD (wet or dry type), many people notice that straight lines start to look wavy or crooked. You may also notice a blurry area near the center of your vision. Over time, this blurry area may get bigger or you may see blank spots. Colors may also seem less bright than before, and you may have more trouble seeing in low lighting."
AMBLYOPIA,"Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is a type of poor vision that usually happens in just 1 eye but less commonly in both eyes. It develops when there's a breakdown in how the brain and the eye work together, and the brain can't recognize the sight from 1 eye. Over time, the brain relies more and more on the other, stronger eye ' while vision in the weaker eye gets worse. It's called 'lazy eye' because the stronger eye works better. But people with amblyopia are not lazy, and they can't control the way their eyes work. Amblyopia starts in childhood, and it's the most common cause of vision loss in kids. Up to 3 out of 100 children have it. The good news is that early treatment works well and usually prevents long-term vision problems."
ANOPHTHALMIA AND MICROPHTHALMIA,"Anophthalmia and microphthalmia are eye conditions that people are born with. Anophthalmia is when a baby is born without one or both of their eyes. Microphthalmia is when one or both of a baby's eyes are small. Both conditions are rare, and can cause vision loss or blindness. There's no treatment that can create a new eye or bring vision back for people born with anophthalmia or microphthalmia. But early treatment can help babies and children with these conditions grow and develop. Anophthalmia and microphthalmia can cause vision problems and blindness. People with these conditions may also have small eye sockets (the bones around the eye). This can change the shape of their face.People with microphthalmia may have other eye conditions, including: Coloboma (when normal tissue in or around the eye is missing) Cataract (a cloudy area in the lens of the eye) Microcornea (when the clear outer layer at the front of the eye is small and unusually curved)"
ASTIGMARTISM,"Astigmatism is a common eye problem that can make your vision blurry or distorted. It happens when your cornea (the clear front layer of your eye) or lens (an inner part of your eye that helps the eye focus) has a different shape than normal. Astigmatism happens when your cornea or lens has a different shape than normal. The shape makes light bend differently as it enters your eye, causing a refractive error. "
ASTIGMARTISM,"blurry vision, needing to squint to see clearly, headaches, eye strain, trouble to see at night"
CATARACT,"A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye (the clear part of the eye that helps to focus light). Cataracts are very common as you get older. In fact, more than half of all Americans age 80 or older either have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of cataracts. "
CATARACT,"cloudy vision, blurry vision, can't see well at night, lamp sunlight seem too bright, see halo arounh lights, seeing double, prescription for eyeglasses changes often"
COLOR BLINDNESS,"If you have color blindness (color vision deficiency), it means you see colors differently than most people. Most of the time, color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between certain colors. Usually, color vision deficiency runs in families. There's no cure, but special glasses and contact lenses can help. The most common type of color vision deficiency makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green. Another type makes blue and yellow look the same. In rare cases, people have complete color vision deficiency, which means they don't see color at all. people see differences between colors. Most people who have color vision deficiency don't have problems with everyday activities."
COLOR BLINDNESS,"The main symptom of color vision deficiency is not seeing colors the way most people do. If you have color vision deficiency, you may have trouble seeing: The difference between colors, How bright colors are, Different shades of colors"
DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,"Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). If you have diabetes, it's important to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year. Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first ' but finding it early can help you take steps to protect your vision. The early stages of diabetic retinopathy usually don't have any symptoms. Some people notice changes in their vision, like trouble reading or seeing faraway objects. These changes may come and go. In later stages of the disease, blood vessels in the retina start to bleed into the vitreous (gel-like fluid that fills your eye). If this happens, you may see dark, floating spots or streaks that look like cobwebs. Sometimes, the spots clear up on their own ' but it's important to get treatment right away. Without treatment, scars can form in the back of the eye. Blood vessels may also start to bleed again, or the bleeding may get worse."
DRY EYE,"Dry eye happens when your eyes don't make enough tears to stay wet, or when your tears don't work correctly. This can make your eyes feel uncomfortable, and in some cases it can also cause vision problems. Dry eye is common ' it affects millions of Americans every year. The good news is that if you have dry eye, there are lots of things you can do to keep your eyes healthy and stay comfortable. symptoms include: scratchy feeling in eye, stinging or burning feelings in eye, red eyes, sensitivity to light, blurry vision"
GLAUCOMA,"Glaucoma is group of eye diseases that can cause'vision loss and blindness'by'damaging a nerve in the back of your eye'called'the optic nerve. The symptoms can start so slowly that you may not notice them. The only way to find out if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam.  At first, glaucoma doesn't usually have any symptoms. That's why half of people with glaucoma don't even know they have it. Over time, you may slowly lose vision, usually starting with your side (peripheral) vision ' especially the part of your vision that's closest to your nose. Because it happens so slowly, many people can't tell that their vision is changing at first. "
LOW VISION,"Low vision is a vision problem that makes it hard to do everyday activities. It can't be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or other standard treatments like medicine or surgery. You may have low vision if you can't see well enough to do things like: Read, Drive, Recognize people's faces. Tell colors apart, See your television or computer screen clearly "
NEARSIGHTEDNESS,"Nearsightedness is a refractive error that makes far-away objects look blurry. It happens when the shape of the eye makes light focus in front of the retina (a light sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye), instead of on it."
NEARSIGHTEDNESS,"trouble seeing far things, needing to squint to see clearly, eye strain, headache"
FARSIGHTEDNESS,"Farsightedness is a refractive error that makes nearby objects look blurry. It happens when the shape of the eye makes light focus behind the retina (a light sensitive layer of tissue at the back of your eye), instead of on it."
FARSIGHTEDNESS,"trouble seeing near things or things that are close, eye strain, headache while reading"
CONJUCTIVITIS,"Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, causes swelling and redness in the inside of your eyelid and the white part of your eye. Your eye may also feel itchy and painful. Pink eye is common, and some types of pink eye spread very easily. You can keep from spreading it to other people by washing your hands often and not sharing items like pillowcases, towels, or makeup. symptoms are: pink or red eyes, itchy or burning eyes, watery eyes, white yellow or green fluid discharge coming from eyes, crust along eyelids or eyelashes, swollen eyelids, sensitivity from bright light, blurry vision"
RETINOBLASTOMA,"Retinoblastoma is a rare eye cancer that forms in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). Retinoblastoma is most common in children younger than age 5 ' but in rare cases it can develop in older children and adults. It can affect 1 eye or both eyes. Retinoblastoma can cause blindness and can also be life-threatening. But early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent vision loss and stop the cancer from spreading. That's why it's important to call your child's doctor right away if you notice signs of retinoblastoma. The most common sign of retinoblastoma is a white pupil (the round black opening in the center of the eye) when a light shines into the eye. Parents often notice this sign when they take a photo of their child using a flash. other symptoms include: eye pain, swelling, redness, watery or teary eyes, poor vision"
DRY EYE,"scratchy feeling in eye, stinging or burning feelings in eye, red eyes, sensitivity to light, blurry vision"
CONJUCTIVITIS,"itchiness, itching, pink eyes, eye pain, redness in eye, burning eyes, yellow discahrge from eye, swollen eyelids, sensitivity from light, blurry vision"

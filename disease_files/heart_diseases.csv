VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT,"A ventricular septal defect (VSD), the most common type of congenital disorder, is an abnormal opening between the right and left ventricles that allows blood to shunt between them. The septum may be entirely absent, resulting in a single ventricle. A large, untreated defect can cause right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.  increasing pulmonary vascular resistance."
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT,"children, heart failure with dusky skin; liver, heart, and spleen enlargement because of systemic venous congestion; diaphoresis; feeding difficulties; rapid, grunting respirations; and increased heart rate. They may also develop severe pulmonary hypertension. poor feeding, sweating, heavy breathing, heart murmur"
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT,"An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an abnormal opening between the left and the right atria. A small opening may cause few symptoms. However, if the opening is large, higher pressure in the left atrium can shunt large amounts of blood into the right atrium, which can result in right heart volume overload, right atrial and ventricular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension."
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT,"children, feeling tired after extreme exertion, respiratory tract infections, heart murmur, Sensations of rapid, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat"
MYOCARDITIS,"Myocarditis is focal or diffuse inflammation of the cardiac muscle (myocardium). It may be acute or chronic and can occur at any age. In many cases, myocarditis fails to produce specific cardiovascular symptoms or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and recovery is usually spontaneous, without residual defects"
MYOCARDITIS,"it may produce mild, continuous pressure or soreness in the chest (unlike the recurring, stress-related pain of angina pectoris). Although myocarditis is usually self-limiting, it may induce myofibril degeneration that results in right- and left-sided heart failure, with cardiomegaly, JVD, dyspnea, persistent fever with resting or exertional tachycardia disproportionate to the degree of fever, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias."
ENDOCARDITIS,"Endocarditis (also known as infective or bacterial endocarditis) is an infection of the endocardium, heart valves, or cardiac prostheses resulting from bacterial or fungal invasion. Most cases of endocarditis occur in I.V. drug abusers, patients with prosthetic heart valves, and those with MVP (especially males with a systolic murmur). Other predisposing conditions include coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, subaortic and valvular aortic stenosis, VSDs, PS, Marfan syndrome, degenerative heart disease (especially calcific aortic stenosis), and, rarely, syphilitic aortic valve"
ENDOCARDITIS,"The invasion of bacteria or fungi produces vegetative growths on the heart valves, endocardial lining of a heart chamber, or endothelium of a blood vessel that may embolize to the spleen, kidneys, central nervous system, and lungs. In endocarditis, fibrin and platelets aggregate on the valve tissue and engulf circulating bacteria or fungi that flourish and produce friable verrucous vegetations. (See Degenerative changes in endocarditis.) Such vegetations may cover the valve surfaces, causing ulceration and necrosis; they may also extend to the chordae tendineae, leading to their rupture and subsequent valvular insufficiency"
ENDOCARDITIS,"malaise, weight loss, anorexia, arthralgia, night sweats, chills, valvular insufficiency, interminnent fever, heavy heart murmur, pain in upper left quadrant, shoulder, abdominal rigidity, hematuria, flank pain, decreased urine output, numbness, tingling in arm, leg, finger, toe, peripheral gangrene"
PERICARDITIS,"Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the fibroserous sac that envelops, supports, and protects the heart. Common causes of this disease include: bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (infectious pericarditis) neoplasms (primary or metastatic from lungs, breasts, or other organs) high-dose radiation to the chest uremia hypersensitivity or autoimmune disease, such as acute rheumatic fever (most common cause of pericarditis in children), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis postcardiac injury such as MI, which later causes an autoimmune reaction (Dressler syndrome) in the pericardium; trauma; or surgery that leaves the pericardium intact but causes blood to leak into the pericardial cavity drugs, such as hydralazine or procainamide idiopathic factors (most common in acute pericarditis)"
PERICARDITIS,"sharp and often sudden pain that usually starts over the sternum and radiates to the neck, shoulders, back, and arms. Chronic constrictive pericarditis causes a gradual increase in systemic venous pressure and produces symptoms similar to those of chronic right sided heart failure fluid retention, ascites, and hepatomegaly"
RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE,"Acute rheumatic fever is a systemic inflammatory disease of childhood, in many cases recurrent, that follows a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Rheumatic heart disease refers to the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever and includes pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, and endocarditis) during the early acute phase and chronic valvular disease later."
RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE,"joint pain, polyarthritis, temperature of at least 100.4 degree farhenheit or 38 degree celsius, swelling, redness, knee pain, elbow pain, fever"
HYPERTENSION,"Hypertension, an intermittent or sustained elevation in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, occurs as two major types: essential (idiopathic) hypertension, the most common, and secondary hypertension, which results from renal disease or another identifiable cause. Malignant hypertension is a severe, fulminant form of hypertension common to both types. Hypertension is a major cause of stroke, cardiac disease, and renal failure."
HYPERTENSION,"Risk factors for hypertension include family history, race (most common in blacks), stress, obesity, a diet high in saturated fats or sodium, tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, and aging. Secondary hypertension may result from renal vascular disease; pheochromocytoma; primary hyperaldosteronism; Cushing syndrome; thyroid, pituitary, or parathyroid dysfunction; coarctation of the aorta; pregnancy; neurologic disorders; and use of hormonal contraceptives or other drugs, such as cocaine, epoetin alfa (erythropoietin), and cyclosporine."
HYPERTENSION,"stroke, blindness, myocardial infraction, proteinuria, edema, renal failure, high blood pressure"
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE,"CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow, usually as a result of atherosclerosis. The result is the loss of oxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissue because of diminished coronary blood flow. This reduction in blood flow can also lead to coronary syndrome (angina or MI). Coronary artery disease (CAD) results as atherosclerotic plaque fills the lumens of the coronary arteries and obstructs blood flow. The primary effect of CAD is a diminished supply of oxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissues."
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE,"the direct result of inadequate oxygen flow to the myocardium. Anginal pain is usually described as a burning, squeezing, or tight feeling in the substernal or precordial chest that may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder blade. Typically, the patient clenches a fist over his chest or rubs the left arm when describing the pain, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fainting, sweating, and cool extremities"
HEART FAILURE,"Heart failure is a syndrome characterized by myocardial dysfunction that leads to impaired pump performance (diminished cardiac output) or to frank heart failure and abnormal circulatory congestion. Congestion of systemic venous circulation may result in peripheral edema or hepatomegaly; congestion of pulmonary circulation may cause pulmonary edema, an acute life-threatening emergency. Pump failure usually occurs in a damaged left ventricle (left-sided heart failure) but may occur in the right ventricle (right- sided heart failure) either as a primary disorder or secondary to left-sided heart failure. Sometimes, left- and right-sided heart failure develop simultaneously"
HEART FAILURE,"Clinical signs of left-sided heart failure include dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles, possibly wheezing, hypoxia, respiratory acidosis, cough, cyanosis or pallor, palpitations, arrhythmias, elevated blood pressure, and pulsus alternans. Clinical signs of right-sided heart failure include dependent peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, JVD, ascites, slow weight gain, arrhythmias, positive hepatojugular reflex, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and syncope."
VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM,"Ventricular aneurysm may cause arrhythmias such as premature ventricular contractions or ventricular tachycardia�palpitations, signs of cardiac dysfunction (weakness on exertion, fatigue, and angina) and, occasionally, a visible or palpable systolic precordial bulge. This condition may also lead to left ventricular dysfunction, with chronic heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, edema, crackles, gallop rhythm, and JVD); pulmonary edema; systemic embolization; and, with left-sided heart failure, pulsus alternans. Ventricular aneurysms enlarge but seldom rupture."
THROMBOPHLEBITIS,"An acute condition characterized by inflammation and thrombus formation, thrombophlebitis may occur in deep (intermuscular or intramuscular) or superficial (subcutaneous) veins. DVT or thrombophlebitis affects small veins, such as the soleal venous sinuses, or large veins, such as the vena cava and the femoral, iliac, and subclavian veins, causing venous insufficiency. It�s often accompanied by incompetence of the communicating veins at the ankle, causing increased venous pressure and fluid migration into the interstitial tissue. Clinical effects include chronic swelling of the affected leg from edema, leading to tissue fibrosis, and induration; skin discoloration from extravasation of blood in subcutaneous tissue; and stasis ulcers around the ankle."
THROMBOPHLEBITIS,"clinical features vary with the site and length of the affected vein. Although DVT may occur asymptomatically, it may also produce severe pain, fever, chills, malaise and, possibly, swelling and cyanosis of the affected arm or leg. Superficial thrombophlebitis produces visible and palpable signs, such as heat, pain, swelling, rubor, tenderness, and induration along the length of the affected vein. Varicose veins may also be present."
RAYNAUD DISEASE,"Raynaud disease is one of several primary arteriospastic disorders characterized by episodic vasospasm in the small peripheral arteries and arterioles, precipitated by exposure to cold or stress. This condition occurs bilaterally and usually affects the hands or, less often, the feet. Raynaud disease is most prevalent in females, particularly those between puberty and 40 years old. It�s a benign condition, requiring no specific treatment and causing no serious sequelae. Although the cause is unknown, several theories account for the reduced digital blood flow: intrinsic vascular wall hyperactivity to cold, increased vasomotor tone due to sympathetic stimulation, and antigen�antibody immune response (the most likely theory because abnormal immunologic test results accompany Raynaud phenomenon). Risk factors include associated diseases (Buerger disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and SLE) and smoking."
RAYNAUD DISEASE,"chills, cold, numbing of fingers, "

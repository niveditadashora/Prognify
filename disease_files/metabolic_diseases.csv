VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY,"A fat-soluble vitamin absorbed in the GI tract, vitamin A maintains epithelial tissue and retinal function. Consequently, deficiency of this vitamin may result in night blindness, decreased color adjustment, keratinization of epithelial tissue, and poor bone growth. Healthy adults have adequate vitamin A reserves to last up to a year; children often don�t. Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intake of foods highin vitamin A (liver, kidney, butter, milk, cream, cheese, and fortifiedmargarine) or carotene, a precursor of vitamin A found in dark green leafy vegetables and yellow or orange fruits and vegetables. malabsorption due to celiac disease, sprue, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis, or habitual use of mineral oil as a laxative massive urinary excretion caused by cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, nephritis, or urinary tract infection decreased storage and transport of vitamin A due to hepatic disease"
VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY,"night blindness, xeropthalmia, dry skin, dry eyes, infertility, delayed growth, stunted growth, throat infection, poor wound healing, slow healing of wound, acne, "
VITAMIN B DEFICIENCY,"Vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble vitamins essential to normal metabolism, cell growth, and blood formation. (See Recommended daily allowance of B complex vitamins.) The most common deficiencies involve thiamine (B1 ), riboflavin (B2 ), niacin (B3 ), pyridoxine (B6 ), and cobalamin (B12 )."
VITAMIN B DEFICIENCY,"yellowing of skin, extreme weakness, fatigue, sensation of pins and needles, nerve damage, mouth ulcers, breathlessness, dizziness, mood cahnges, irritability, loss of sense, touch, dementia, loss of apetite, weight loss"
VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency leads to scurvy or inadequate production of collagen, an extracellular substance that binds the cells of the teeth, bones, and capillaries. It�s essential for wound healing and burn recovery. Vitamin C is also an important factor in metabolizing such amino acids as tyrosine and phenylalanine. It also acts as a reductant, activating enzymes in the body, as well as converting folic acid into useful components."
VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY,"Clinical features of vitamin C deficiency appear as capillaries become increasingly fragile. In an adult, it produces petechiae, ecchymoses, follicular hyperkeratosis (especially on the buttocks and legs), anemia, anorexia, limb and joint pain (especially in the knees), pallor, weakness, swollen or bleeding gums, loose teeth, lethargy, insomnia, poor wound healing, and ocular hemorrhages in the bulbar conjunctivae. (See Scurvy�s effect on gums and legs.) Vitamin C deficiency can also cause beading, fractures of the costochondral junctions of the ribs or epiphysis, and such psychological disturbances as irritability, depression, hysteria, and hypochondriasis."
VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY,"weakness, bleeding gums, sore arms or legs, roughness of skin, poor wound healing"
VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY,"Vitamin D deficiency, commonly called rickets, causes failure of normal bone calcification, which occurs through several mechanisms: decreased calcium and phosphorus (the major components of bone) from the intestines, increased excretion of calcium from renal tubules, and increased parathyroid secretion resulting in increased release of calcium from the bone. The deficiency results in rickets in infants and young children and osteomalacia in adults. With treatment, the prognosis is good. However, in rickets, bone deformities usually persist, whereas in osteomalacia, such deformities may disappear. Vitamin D deficiency results from inadequate dietary intake of preformed vitamin D, malabsorption of vitamin D, or too little exposure to sunlight"
VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY,"bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, depression, anxiety, stress, knocked knees, bow shaped legs, softening of bones, "
IODINE DEFICIENCY,"Iodine deficiency is the absence of sufficient levels of iodine to satisfy daily metabolic requirements. Because the thyroid gland uses most of the body�s iodine stores, iodine deficiency is apt to cause hypothyroidism and thyroid gland hypertrophy (endemic goiter). Other effects of deficiency range from dental caries to cretinism in neonates born to iodine-deficient mothers. Iodine deficiency is most common in pregnant or lactating women due to their exaggerated metabolic need for this element. Iodine deficiency responds readily to treatment with iodine supplements."
IODINE DEFICIENCY,"Iodine deficiency usually results from insufficient intake of dietary sources of iodine, such as iodized table salt, seafood, and dark green, leafy vegetables. (Normal iodine requirements range from 35 ?g/day for infants to 150 ?g/day for lactating women; the average adult needs 1 ?g/kg of body weight.) Iodine deficiency may also result from an increase in metabolic demands during pregnancy, lactation, and adolescence."
IODINE DEFICIENCY,"loss of motivation, fatigue, dry skin, inelastic skin, puffy face, thick tongue, delayed relaxation, poor memory, hearing loss, chills"
POTASSIUM IMBALANCE,"Because many foods contain potassium, hypokalemia seldom results from a dietary deficiency. Instead, potassium loss may result from: excessive GI losses, such as diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, or chronic laxative abuse (Vomiting and gastric suction cause dehydration, resulting in hyperaldosteronism [sodium retention and potassium excretion occur].) trauma (injury, burns, or surgery), in which damaged cells release potassium, which enters serum or ECF, to be excreted in the urine chronic renal disease, with tubular potassium wasting certain drugs, especially potassium-wasting diuretics, steroids, and certain sodium-containing antibiotics (carbenicillin) acid�base imbalances, which cause potassium shifting into cells without true depletion in alkalosis prolonged potassium-free I.V. therapy hyperglycemia, causing osmotic diuresis and glycosuria Cushing syndrome, primary hyperaldosteronism, excessive licorice ingestion, and severe serum magnesium deficiency refeeding syndrome"
POTASSIUM IMBALANCE,"weakness, numbness, tingling, nausea, vomitting, abdominal cramps, hypotension, palpitations, changes in behaviour, slow and weak pulse, cardiac standstill"
SODIUM IMBALANCE,"A low-sodium diet or excessive use of diuretics may induce hyponatremia (decreased serum sodium concentration); dehydration may induce hypernatremia (increased serum sodium concentration). Causes of hypernatremia include: decreased water intake (When severe vomiting and diarrhea cause water loss that exceeds sodium loss, serum sodium levels rise, but overall ECF volume decreases.) excess adrenocortical hormones, as in Cushing syndrome ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) salt intoxication (less common), which may be produced by excessive ingestion of table salt"
SODIUM IMBALANCE,"loss of energy, fatigue, headache, confusion, muscle spasm, loe blood pressure, dark scanty urine, irritability, neurological menifestations, brhaviour changes, seizures"

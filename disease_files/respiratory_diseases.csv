ASBESTOSIS,"Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung disease caused by breathing in asbestos fibers. Asbestos is a heat-resistant mineral that used to be common in insulation, vinyl floor tiles, cement, brake linings and other products. It can take 20 or 30 years from the time people started breathing in asbestos to the time they first notice symptoms. The lung damage caused by asbestosis is permanent."
ASBESTOSIS,"long term cough, shortness of breath even while resting, dry cough, chest pain"
ASTHAMA,"Asthma is a chronic disease in which certain triggers can cause your airways to swell and fill with mucus. This narrows your airways and makes it harder to breathe.  Certain things can make your airways become swollen and filled with mucus. The swelling and mucus makes your airways narrower, so it is hard for air to pass through. Asthma may also cause your airways to become small and tight. This makes your airways narrower and makes it hard for air to pass through."
ASTHAMA,"wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, feeling short of breath, struggling to breath, difficulty speaking, pale grey sweating, tired lathargic, unconsciousness"
BRONCHITIS,"Bronchitis is swelling in your air passages (bronchi). Bronchi connect your windpipe (trachea) with tiny air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs. Your body absorbs inhaled oxygen across the walls of the alveoli. When you have bronchitis, your bronchi are swollen and filled with extra sticky mucus. This makes it harder for your to breathe, and makes you cough. "
BRONCHITIS,"Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus — the same viruses that causes the common cold. The virus attacks our airways, which causes redness, swelling and extra mucous production. Acute bronchitis can also be caused by things that irritate your airways, such as smoke. Bronchitis is considered chronic when you have a cough with mucus on most days for three months of the year. "
BRONCHITIS,"coughing up mucus, difficulty in breathing, long lasting cough, high fever, chest and shoulder pain, cough up blood, bad tasting mucus, shortness of breathe, swollen feet"
COMMON COLD,"The common cold is probably the most common respiratory (breathing) disease. Many different viruses can cause a cold; over a hundred cold viruses (rhinoviruses) have been identified so far. Cold viruses are very contagious — it's easy to catch them from other people. When someone has a cold, there is a lot of the cold-causing virus in their nose and throat. If the person coughs or sneezes, they can spray the virus into the air and infect other people directly. If the person with the cold coughs or sneezes on objects, or on their hands, those things can carry the virus too. Cold viruses can live for many hours on objects like toys, door handles, telephones, pens, tissues and more. If a healthy person picks up an object covered with cold germs, then touches their nose, mouth or eyes, they can catch the virus."
COMMON COLD,"sore throat, cough, runny nose, congestion, sneezing, mild headache, achy muscles"
CROUP,"Croup is a viral infection that causes swelling in the throat and vocal cords (larynx). Croup commonly affects children under five because their airways are smaller and more prone to swelling. One of the tell-tale signs of croup is a loud, ""barky"" cough that is worse at night. The most common are parainfluenza, influenza (flu), adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and measles. "
CROUP,"loud cough, barking cough, wheezing noise while breathing, hoarse raspy voice, runny stuffy nose, fever, feeling tired"
CYSTIC FIBROSIS,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, fatal genetic disease affecting young Canadians. Cystic fibrosis mainly affects people's lungs and digestion. People with cystic fibrosis have an unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs their lungs, makes it hard to breathe, and can lead to life-threatening lung infections. CF also affects the pancreas: thick secretions there stop the release of the digestive enzymes that normally help break down food, making it hard for people to digest and absorb nutrients. The mucus can also block the bile duct in the liver, which eventually causes permanent liver damage in some people with CF."
HANTAVIRUS,"Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome is a rare but serious lung disease spread by deer, mice and other wild rodents. Hantavirus is found in the saliva, urine and droppings of infected rodents. People can get Hantavirus when they breathe in tiny particles of fresh saliva, urine, droppings or nesting materials that are infected with the virus. For example, you could get Hantavirus if you sweep out a garage that has infected mice nesting in it. Sweeping stirs up tiny particles of the infected droppings, urine or saliva, and makes them float in the air. When you breathe in these tiny infected particles, the virus enters your lungs and you can get sick."
HANTAVIRUS,"fever, muscle ache, thigh, hips, back, shoulder ache, dizziness, feeling tired, stomach pain, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, coughing "
INFLUENZA,"The flu is a highly contagious illness caused by the influenza virus. The influenza virus causes infections of the nose, throat and lungs. the flu is uncomfortable and tiring. It can keep people in bed for days or even a couple of weeks. Some people are more at risk for serious complications from the flu, including seniors, young children, and people with long-term lung diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Flu can make asthma symptoms worse and cause COPD flare-ups."
INFLUENZA,"sudden fever, feeling feverish, chills, cough, sore throat, loss of apetite, muscle ache, fatigue, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, fast breathing, blue or grey lips, vomitting, seizures, dehydration"
LUNG CANCER,"worst cough, long lasting cough, chest pain doesn't go away, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, wheezing, losing voice, frequent pneumonia, swollen neck and face, not feeling hingry, losing weight, feeling tired,"
PNEUMONIA,"Pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) is swelling (inflammation) of one or both lungs that is usually caused by an infection. Many different germs can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When you breathe in these germs, they can settle in the air sacs (alveoli) of your lungs. Deep in your lungs, the germs may grow and overcome your body's normal defenses. After the lungs become infected, the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs fill with pus and mucus. This swelling (inflammation) of the air sacs makes them less stretchy and keeps oxygen from properly reaching your blood stream."
PNEUMONIA,"If you have pneumonia caused by a virus it is called viral pneumonia. Many different viruses can cause viral pneumonia, including the flu (influenza) and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), a virus that is common in children. Viral pneumonia is usually less serious than bacterial pneumonia. If you have pneumonia caused by bacteria it is called bacteria pneumonia. The most common type of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Other bacteria that cause pneumonia include: mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila."
PNEUMONIA,"fever, heavy cough, yellow-green phlegm, mucus, shortness of breath, feeling tired, chest pain"
TUBERCULOSIS,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease caused by breathing in a bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB usually infects the lungs. TB can also infect other parts of the body, including the kidneys, spine and brain. People can have TB and not be sick, this is called latent TB. Latent TB is when a person has the TB bacteria in their body but it is not growing. The latent TB can become active TB at any time and make you very sick. If you have inactive TB infection you need to get treatment to cure your TB infection. TB is contagious. People who are sick with active TB disease spread TB germs through the air. It's important for people with TB to get treatment right away. TB treatments can cure TB and prevent it from spreading to others. "
TUBERCULOSIS,"A cough that lasts two weeks or more, especially if you cough up fluid or blood comes from your lungs when you cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, loss of apetite"

"Cardiovascular Disorders Introduction The cardiovascular system begins its activity when the fetus is barely a month old and is the last body system to cease activity at the end of life. This system is so vital that its activity defines the presence of life. LIFE-GIVING TRANSPORT SYSTEM The heart, arteries, veins, and lymphatics form the cardiovascular network that serves as the body’ s transp ort system, bringing life-supporting oxygen and nutrients to cells, removin g metabolic waste products, and carrying hormones from one part of the body to another . Often called the circulatory system , it may be divided into two branches: pulmonary circulation , in which blood picks up new oxyg en and liberates the waste product carbon dioxide; and systemic cir culation  (including coronary circulation), in which blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all active cells while transporting waste products to the kidneys, liver , and skin for excretion. Circulation requires normal functioning of the heart, which propels blood through the system by continuous rhythmic contractions. Located behind the sternum, the heart is a muscular organ the size of a man’ s fist. It has three layers: the endocar dium —the smooth inner layer; the myocar dium — the thick, muscular middle layer that contracts in rhythmic beats; and the epicar dium —the thin, serous membrane, or outer surface of the heart .Covering the entire heart is a saclike membrane called the pericar dium , which has two layers: a visceral  layer that’s in contact with the heart and a parietal , or outer , layer . To prevent irritation when the heart moves against this layer during contraction, fluid lubricates the parietal pericardium. The heart has four chambers: two thin-walled chambers called atria  and two thick-walled chambers called ventricles.  The atria serve  as reservoirs during ventricular contraction (systole) and as booster pumps during ventricular relaxation (diastole). The left ventricle propels blood through the systemic circulation. The right ventricle, which forces blood through the pulmonary circulation, is much thinner than the left because it meets only one sixth the resistance. ELDER TIP  As a person’ s body ages, the ventricular and aortic walls stiffen, decr easing the heart’ s pumping action. HEART V ALVES Two kinds of valves work inside the heart: atrioventricular  (AV) and semilunar . The AV valve between the right atrium and the ventricle has three leaflets, or cusps, and three papillary muscles; hence, it’s called the tricuspid valve . The AV valve between the left atrium and the ventricle consists of two cusps shaped like a bishop’ s hat, or miter , and two papillary muscles and is called the mitral valve . The tricuspid and mitral valves prevent blood backflow from the ventricles to the atria during ventricular contraction. The leaflets of both valves are attached to the ventricles’ papillary muscles by thin, fibrous bands called chordae tendineae ; the leaflets separate and descend funnel-like into the ventricles during diastole and are pushed upward and together during systole to occlude the mitral and tricuspid orifices. The valves’ action isn’t entirely passive because papillary muscl es contract during systole and prevent the leaflets from prolapsing into the atria during ventricular contraction. The two semilunar valves, which resemble half-moons, prevent blood backflow from the aorta and pulmonary arteries into the ventricles when those chambers relax and fill with blood from the atria. They’re referred to as the aortic valve  and pulmonic valve  for their respective arteries. ELDER TIP  In elderly people, fibr otic and scler otic changes thicken heart valves and r educe their flexibility . These changes lead to rigidity and incomplete closur e of the valves, which may r esult in systolic or diastolic murmurs.THE CARDIAC CYCLE Diastole  is the phase of ventricular relaxation and filling. As diastole begins, ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure, and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. As ventricular pressure continues to fall below atrial pressure, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and blood flows rapidly into the ventricles. Atrial contraction then increases the volume of ventricular filling by pumping 15% to 25% more blood into the ventricles. When systole  begins, the ventricular muscle contracts, raising ventricular pressure above atrial pressure and closing the mitral and tricuspid valves. When ventricular pressure finally becomes greater than that in the aorta and pulmonary artery , the aortic and pulmonic valves open, and the ventricles eject blood. Ventricular pressure continues to rise as blood is expelled from the heart. As systole ends, the ventricles relax and stop ejecting blood, and ventricular pressure falls, closing both valves. S1 (the first heart sound) is heard as the ventricles contract and the AV valves close. S1 is loudest at the heart’ s apex, over the mitral area. S2 (the second heart sound), which is normally rapid and sharp, occurs when the aortic and pulmonic valves close. S2 is loudest at the heart’ s base (second intercostal space [ICS] on both sides of the sternum). Ventricular diste ntion during diastole, which can occur in systolic heart failure, creates low-frequency vibrations that may be heard as a third heart sound (S3), or ventricular gallop. An atrial  gallop (S4) may appear at the end of diastole, just before S1, if atrial filling is forced into a ventricle that has become less compliant or overdistended or has a decreased ability to contract. A pressure rise and ventricular vibrations cause this sound. CARDIAC CONDUCTION The heart’s conduction system is composed of specialized cells capable of generating and conducting rhythmic electrical impulses to stimulate heart contraction. This system includes the sinoatrial (SA) node, the AV junction, the bundle of His and its bundl e branches, and the ventricular conduction tissue and Purkinje fibers. Normally , the SA node controls the heart rate and rhythm at 60 to 100 beats/minute. Because the SA node has the lowest resting potential, it’s the heart’ s pacemaker . If it defaults, another part of the system takes over. The AV junction may emer ge at 40 to 60 beats/minute; the bundle  of His andbundle branches at 30 to 40 beats/minute; and ventricular condu ction tissue at 20 to 30 beats/minute. ELDER TIP  As the myocar dium of the aging heart becomes mor e irritable, extrasystoles may occur along with sinus arr hythmias and sinus bradycar dias. In addition, incr eased fibr ous tissue infiltrates the SA nodes and internodal atrial tracts, which may cause atrial fibrillation and flutter . CARDIAC OUTPUT Cardiac output —the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle into the aorta each minute—is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume  (the amount of blood the left ventr icle ejects during each contraction) by the heart rate (number of beats/minute). When cellular demands increase, stroke volume or heart rate must increase. Many factors affect the heart rate, including exercise, pregna ncy, and stress. When the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, the heart rate increases; when the parasympathetic system releases acetylcholine, it slows. As a person ages, the heart rate takes longer to normalize after exercise. Stroke volume depends on the ventricular blood volume and pressure at the end of diastole (preload), resistance to ejection (afterloa d), and the myocardium’ s contractile strength (inotropy). Changes in preload, afterload, or inotropic state can alter the stroke volume. ELDER TIP  Exercise car diac output declines slightly with age. A decrease in maximum heart rate and contractility may cause this change. CIRCULA TION AND PULSES Blood circulate s through three types of vessels: arteries, veins , and capillaries.  The sturdy, pliable walls of the arteries adjust to the volume of blood leaving the heart. The major artery branching out of the left ventricle is the aorta. Its segments and subbranches ultimately divide into minute, thin-walled (one-cell thick) capillaries. Capillaries pass the blood to the veins, which return it to the heart. In the veins, valves prevent blood backflow .ELDER TIP  Aging contributes to arterial and venous insufficiency as the str ength and elasticity of blood vessels decr ease. Pulses are felt best wherever an artery runs near the skin and over a hard structure. (See Pulse points .) Easily found pulses are: Pulse Points Peripheral pulse rhythm should correspond exactly to the auscultatory heart rhythm. The pulse’ s character may offer useful information. For example, pulsus alternans , a strong beat followed by a weak one, can mean myocardial weakness. A water -hammer  (or Corrigan ) pulse , a forceful boundin g pulse best felt in the carotid arteries or in the forearm, accompanies increased pulse pressure—commonly with capillary pulsations of the fingernails (Quincke sign ). This pulse usually indicates aortic valve regur gitation. Pulsus bisferiens , a doub le periph eral pulse for every apical beat, can signal aortic regurgitation or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . Pulsus bigeminus  is a coupled rhythm; you feel its beat in pairs. Pulsus paradoxus  is exaggerated waxing and waning of the arterial pressure (≥15 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration), often seen in cardiac tamponade. radial artery —anterolateral aspect of the wrist temporal artery —in front of the ear , above and lateral to the eye common car otid artery —neck (side) femoral artery —groin The lymphatic system also plays a role in the cardiovascular network. Originating in tissue spaces, the lymphatic system drains fluid and other plasma components that build up in extravascular spaces and reroutes them back to the circulatory system as lymph, a plasmalike fluid. Lymphatics also extract bacteria and foreign bodies. CARDIOV ASCULAR ASSESSMENT Physical assessment provides vital information about cardiovascular status. Check for underlying cardiovascular disorders, such as central cyanosis (impaired gas exchange), edema (heart failure or valvular disease), and clubbing (congenital cardiovascular disease). Palpate the peripheral pulses bilaterally and evaluate their rate, equality , and quality on a scale of 0 (absent) to +4 (bounding). (See Pulse amplitude scale .) Pulse amplitude scale To record your patient’ s pulse amplitude, use this standard scale: 0: Pulse isn’ t palpable. +1: Pulse is thready , weak, dif ficult to find, may fade in and out, and disappears easily with pressure. +2: Pulse is constant but not strong; light pressure must be applied or pulse will disappear . +3: Pulse considered normal. Is easily palpable, doesn’ t disappear with pressure. +4: Pulse is strong, bounding, and doesn’ t disappear with pressure. Inspect the carotid arteries for equal appearance. Auscultate for bruits; then palpate the arteries individually , one side at a time, for thrills  (fine vibrations due to irregular blood flow). Check for pulsations in the jugular veins (more easily seen than felt). Watch for jugular vein distention (JVD)—a possible sign of right-sided heart failure, valvular stenosis, cardiac tamponade, or pulmonary embolism. T ake blood pressure readings in both arms while the patient is lying, sitting, and standing. Palpate the precordium for any abnormal pulsations, such as lifts, heaves, or thrills. Use the palms (at the base of the fingertips) or the fingertips. The normal apex will be felt as a light tap and extends over 1″ (2.5 cm) or less. Systematically auscultate the anterior chest wall for each of the four heart sounds in the aortic area (second ICS at the right sternal border), pulmonic area (second ICS at the left sternal border), right ventricular area (lower half of the left sternal border), and mitral area (fifth ICS at the midclavicular line). However , don’ t limit your auscultation to these four areas. V alvular sounds may be heard all over the precordium. Therefore, inch your stethoscope in a Z pattern, from the base of the heart across and down and then over to the apex, or start at the apex and work your way up. For low-pitched sounds, use the bell of the stethoscope; for high-pitched sounds, the diaphragm. Carefully inspect each area for pulsations, and palpate for thrills. Check the location of apical pulsation for deviations in normal size (3/8″ to 3/4″ [1 to 2 cm]) and position (in the mitral area)—possible signs of left ventricular hypertrophy , left-sided valvular disease, or right ventricular disease. Listen for the vibrating sound of turbulent blood flow through a stenotic or incompetent valve. T ime the murmur to determine where it occurs in the cardiac cycle—between S1 and S2 (systolic), between S2 and the following S1 (diastolic), or throughout systole (holosystolic). Finally , listen for the scratching or squeaking of a pericardial friction rub. SPECIAL CARDIOV ASCULAR TESTS Electrocardiography (ECG) measures electrical activity by recording currents transmi tted by the heart. It can detect ischemia, injur y, necrosis,bundle branch blocks, fascic ular blocks, conduction delay, chamber enlar gement, and arrhythmias. In Holter monitoring, a tape recording tracks as many as 100,000 cardiac cycles over a 12- or 24-hour period. This test may be used to assess the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs or to evaluate arrhythmia symptoms. A signal-averaged ECG will identify afterpotentials, which are associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmias. (See Positioning chest electr odes, page 5.) Positioning chest electr odes To record the 12-lead electrocardiogram, place electrodes on the patient’ s arms and legs (with the ground lead on the patient’ s right leg). The three standard limb leads (I, II, III) and the three augmented leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) are recorded using these electrodes. To record the precordial (chest) leads, place the electrodes as follows: V1—fourth ICS, right sternal border V2—fourth ICS, left sternal border V3—midway between V2 and V4 V4—fifth ICS, left midclavicular line V5—fifth ICS, left anterior axillary line V6—fifth ICS, left midaxillary line Chest X-rays may reveal cardiac enlar gement and aortic dilation. They also assess pulmonary circulation. When pulmonary venous and arterial pressures rise, characteristic changes appear , such as dilation of the pulmonary veno us shadows. When pulmonary venous pressu re exceeds oncotic pressure  of the blood, capillary fluid leaks into lung tissues, causing pulmonary edem a. This fluid may settle in the alveoli, producing  a butterfly pattern, or the lungs may appear cloudy or hazy; in the interlobular septa, sharp linear densities (Kerley lines) may appear . Exercise testing  intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treadmill determines the heart’ s response to physica l stress. This test measures blood pressure and ECG changes during increasingly rigorous exercises. Myocardial ischemia, abnormal blood pressure response, or arrhythmias indicate the circulatory system’ s failure to adapt to exercise. Cardiac catheter ization evaluates chest pain, the need for coronary artery surgery or angioplasty , congenit al heart defects, and valvular heart disease and determines the extent of heart failure. Right-sided catheterization involves threading a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter , which can measure cardiac  output, through a vein into the right side of the heart, pulmonary artery, and its branch es in the lungs to measure right atrial, rightventricular , pulmonary artery , and pulmonary artery wedg e pressures (PAWPs). Left-sided catheterization entails retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle or transseptal catheterization of the left atrium. Ventriculography during left-sided catheterization involves injecting radiopaque dye into the left ventricle to measure ejection fraction and to disclose abnormal heart wall motion or mitral valve incompetence. In coronary angiography , radiopaque material injected into coronary arteries allows cineangiographic visualization of coronary arterial narrowing or occlusion. Echocardiography uses echoes from pulsed high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to evaluate cardiac structures. Two-dimensional echocardiography (most common), in which an ultrasound beam rapidly sweeps through an arc, produces a cross-sectional or fan-shaped view of cardiac structure s. Contrast agents may be used for image enhancement. Doppler echoca rdiography records blood flow within the cardiovascular system. Color Doppler echocard iography shows the direction of blood flow, which provides information about the degree of valvular insuf ficiency . Transesophageal echocardiography combines ultrasound with endoscopy to better view the heart’s structures . This procedure allows images to be taken from the heart’ s posterior aspect. Echocardiography provides information about valve leaflets, size and dimensions of heart chambers, and thickness and motion of the septum and the ventricular walls. It can also reveal intracardiac masses, detect pericardial effusion, diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , and estimate cardiac output and ejection fraction. This test can also evaluate possible aortic dissection when it involves the ascending aorta. In multiple-gated acquisition scanning (MUGA), a radioactive isotope in the intravascular compartment allows measurement of stroke volume, wall motion, and ventricular ejection fraction. Myocardial imaging uses a radioactive isotope to detect abnormalities in myocardial perfusion. This agent concentrates in normally perfused areas of the myocardium but not in ischemic areas (“cold spots”), which may be permanent (scar tissue) or temporary (from transient ischemia). These tests can be done as exercise studies or can be combined with drugs (nuclear stress test), in patients unable to exercise. Peripheral arteriography consists of a fluoroscopic X-ray after arterial injection of a contrast medium. Similarly , phlebography defines the venoussystem after injection of a contrast medium into a vein. Doppler ultrasonography evaluates the peripheral vascular system and assesses peripheral artery disease (PAD) when combined with sequential systolic blood pressure readings. Endomyocardial biopsy can detect cardiomyopathy , infiltrative myocardial diseases, and, most often, transplant rejection. Electrophysiologic studies help diagnose conduction system disease and serious arrhythmias. Electronic induction and termination of arrhythmias aid drug selection. Endocardial mapping detects an arrhythmia’ s focus using a finger electrode. Epicardial mapping uses a computer and a device containing electrodes that’ s slipped over the heart to detect arrhythmias. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can investigate cardiac structure and function. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are used to assess myocardial metabolism. Electron-beam computed tomography , also known as ultrafast computed tomography , is used to detect microcalcifications in the coronary arteries and can give a coronary calcium score. This test is useful for identifying early coronary artery disease (CAD). Blood tests Cardiac enzymes (cellular proteins released into blood after cell membrane injury) confirm acute myocardia l infarction (MI) or severe cardiac trauma. All cardiac enzymes—creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase, for example—are also found in other cells. Fractionation of enzymes can determine the source of damaged cells. For example, three fractions of CK are isolated, one of which (an isoenzyme called CK-MB ) is found only in cardiac cells. CK-MB in the blood indicates injury to myocardial cells. Measurement of a cardiac protei n called troponin  is the most precise way to determine whether a patient has experienced an MI. Some 6 hours after an MI, a blood test can detect two forms of troponin: T and I. Troponin T levels peak about 2 days after an MI and return to normal about 16 days later. Troponin I levels reach their peak in less than 1 day after an MI and return to normal in about 7 days. MANAGING CARDIOV ASCULAR DISEASEPatients with cardiovascular disease pose a tremendous challenge. Their sheer numbers alone compel a thorough understanding of cardiovascular anatomy , physiology , and pathophysiology . Anticipate a high anxiety level in cardiac patients, and provide  support and reassurance, especially during procedures such as cardiac catheterization. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are widely prescribed and offer education and support along with exercise instruction. Rehabilitation programs begin in healthcare facilities and continue on an outpatient basis. Helping the patient resume a satisfying lifestyle requires planning and comprehensive teaching. Inform the patient about healthcare facilities and organizations that of fer cardiac rehabilitation programs. Congenital Acyanotic Defects VENTRICULAR SEPT AL DEFECT Causes and Incidence In ventricular septal defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart disorder , an opening in the septum between the ventricles allows blood to shunt between the left and the right ventricles. This disease accounts for up to 30% of all congenital heart defects. Although most children with congenital heart  defects are otherwise normal, in some, VSD coexists with additional birth defects, especially Down syndrome and other autosomal trisomies, renal anomalies, and such cardiac defects as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and coarctati on of the aorta. VSDs are located in the membranous or muscular portion of the ventricular septum and vary in size. Some defects close spontaneou sly; in other defects, the entire septum is absent, creating  a single ventricle. The prognosis is good for defects that close spontaneously or are correctable surgically but poor for untreated defects, which are sometimes fatal by age 1, usually from secondary complications. Less than 1% of neonates are born with VSD.  In 80% to 90% of neonates  who are born with this disorder , the hole is small and will usually close spontaneously . In the remaining 10% to 20% of neonates, surgery is needed to close the hole. (See Understanding ventricular septal defect , page 7.) Understanding V entricular Septal Defect A ventri cular septal defect (VSD), the most common type of congenital disorder , is an abnormal opening between the right and left ventricles that allows blood to shunt between them. Not always readily apparent at birth, the defect can be small and may close spontaneously . The septum may be entirely absent, resulting  in a single ventricle. A large, untreated defect can cause right ventricular hypertrophy , pulmonary hyper tension, and heart failure. VSD is class ified as an increased pulmonary blood flow defect. PathophysiologyIn neonates with VSD, the ventricular septum fails to close completely by the eighth week of gestation, as it would normally . VSD isn’t readily apparent at birth, because right and left ventricular pressures are about equal, so blood doesn’ t shunt through the defect. As the pulmonary vasculature gradually relaxes, 4 to 8 weeks after birth, right ventricular pressure decreases, allowing blood to shunt from the left to the right ventricle. In small or restrictive defects, right ventricle pressure is only slightly elevated, while pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) remain normal. In moderate defects, the size of the defect determines the magn itude of the shunt. When right  ventricular pressure decreases, the left atrium and ventricle may become fluid overloaded. Because large defects do not meet a lot of flow resistance, the pressure of the ventricles is equal at first. As PVR decreases, volume increases to the pulmonary syste m, in turn increasing the volum e of the left ventricle. This, in turn, can create left ventricular dilation, followed by increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary venous pressure. Complications Right arterial and ventricular hypertrophy Heart failure Pulmonary hypertension Signs and Symptoms Clinical features  of VSD vary with the defect’ s size, the shunting’ s effect on the pulmonary vasculature, and the infant’ s age. In a small VSD , shunting is minimal, and PAP and heart size remain normal. Such defects may eventually close spontaneously without ever causing symptoms. Initially , large VSD shunts cause left atrial and left ventricular hypertrophy . Later , an uncorrected VSD will cause right ventricular hypertrophy due to increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Eventually , biventricular heart failure and cyanosis (from reversal of shunt direction) occur . Resulting cardiac hypertrophy may make the anterior chest wall prominent. A lar ge VSD increases the risk of pneumonia. Infants with large VSDs are thin and small and gain weight slowly . They may develop heart failure with dusky skin; liver, heart, and spleen enlar gement because of systemic venous congestion; diaphoresis; feeding difficulties; rapid, grunting respirations; and increased heart rate. They mayalso develop severe pulmonary hypertension. Fixed pulmonary hypertension may occur much later in life with right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome), causing cyanosis and clubbing of the nail beds. The typical murmur associated with a VSD is blowing or rumbling and varies in frequency . In the neonate, a moderately loud early systolic murmur may be heard along the lower left sternal border . About the second or third day after birth, the murmur may become louder and longer . In infants, the murmur may be loudest near the heart’ s base and may suggest pulmonary stenosis (PS). A small VSD may produce a functional murmur or a characteristic loud, harsh systolic murmur . Larger VSDs produce audible murmurs (at least a grade 3 pansystolic), loudest at the fourth ICS, usually with a thrill; however , a large VSD with minimal pressure gradient may have no audible murmur . In addition, the pulmonic component of S2 sounds loud and is widely split. Palpation reveals displacement of the point of maximal impulse to the left. When fixed pulmonary hypertension is present, a diastolic murmur may be audible on auscultation, the systolic murmur becomes quieter , and S2 is greatly accentuated. Diagnosis Diagnostic findings include: Chest X-ray is normal in small defects; in lar ge VSDs, it shows cardiomegaly , left atrial and left ventricular enlar gement, and prominent pulmonary vascular markings. ECG is normal in children with small VSDs; in lar ge VSDs, it shows left and right ventricular hypertrophy , suggesting pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography may detect a lar ge VSD and its location in the septum, estimate the size of a left-to-right shunt, suggest pulmonary hypertension, and identify associated lesions and complications. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS  Cardiac catheterization determines the VSD’ s size and exact location, calculates the degr ee of shunting by comparing the blood oxygen saturation in each ventricle, determines the extent of pulmonary hypertension, and detects associated defects. TreatmentIn mild cases, no treatment is needed, although the infant should be closely followed to make sure that the hole closes properly as the infant grows. Large defects usually require early surgical correction before heart failure and irreversible pulmonary vascular disease develop. For small defects, surgery consi sts of simple suture closure. Moderate to large defects require insertion of a patch graft, using cardiopulmonary bypass. In patients with heart failure, digoxin and diuretics may be prescribed to control symptoms. In patients who develop increased pulmonary resistance and irreversible pulmonary vascular changes that produce a reversible right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome), a heart– lung transplant may be required. If the child has other defects and will benefit from delaying  surgery, pulmonary artery banding norm alizes pressures and flow distal to the band and prevents pulmonary vascular disease, allowing postponement of surgery. (Pulmonary artery banding is done only when the child has other complications.) A rare complica tion of VSD repair is complete heart block from interference with the bundle of His during surgery. (Hear t block may require temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation.) Before sur gery, treatment consists of: digoxin, sodium restriction, and diuretics to prevent heart failure careful monitoring by physical examination, X-ray , and ECG to detect increased pulmonary hypertension, which indicates a need for early surgery measures to prevent infection (prophylactic antibiotics, e.g., to prevent infective endocarditis) Generally , postoperative treatment includes a brief period of mechanical ventilation. The patient will need analgesics and may also require diuretics to increase urine output, continuous infusions of nitroprusside or adrener gic agents to regulate blood pressure and cardiac output and, in rare cases, a temporary pacemaker . Special Considerations Although the parents of an infant with VSD often suspect something is wrong with their child before diagnosis, they need psychologica l support to help them accept the reality of a serious cardiac disorder . Because surgery may take place months after diagnosis, parent teaching is vital to preventcomplications until the child is scheduled for surgery or the defect closes. Thorough explanations of all tests are also essential. Instruct parents to watch for signs of heart failure, such as poor feeding, sweating, and heavy breathing. If the child is receiving digoxin or other medications, tell the parents how to give it and how to recognize adverse ef fects. Caution them to keep medications out of the reach of all children. Teach parents to recognize and report early signs of infection and to avoid exposing the child to people with obvious infections. Encourage parents to let the child engage in normal activities. Tell parents to follow up with their pediatrician. Also tell them that child life therapy may be appropriate if their child displays delayed growth and development or failure to thrive. Stress the importance of prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery. After sur gery to correct VSD: Monitor vital signs and intake and output. Maintain the infant’ s body temperature with an overbed warmer . Give catecholamines, nitroprusside, and diuretics, as ordered; analgesics as needed. Monitor central venous pressure (CVP), intra-arterial blood pressure, and left atrial or P AP readings. Assess heart rate and rhythm for signs of conduction block. Check oxygenation, particularly in a child who requires mechanical ventilation. Suction to maintain a patent airway and to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, as needed. Monitor pacemaker ef fectiveness if needed. W atch for signs of failure, such as bradycardia and hypotension. Reassure parents and allow them to participate in their child’ s care. ATRIAL SEPT AL DEFECT Causes and Incidence In an atrial septal defect (ASD) , an opening between the left and the right atria allows shunting of blood between the chambers. Ostium secundum defect  (most common) occurs in the region of the fossa ovali s and occasionally extends inferiorly , close to the vena cava; sinus venosus defectoccurs in the superior–posterior portion of the atrial septum,  sometimes extending into the vena cava, and is almost always associated with abnormal draina ge of pulmonary veins into the right atrium; ostium primum defect  occurs in the inferior portion of the septum primum and is usually associated with AV valve abnor malities (cleft mitral valve) and conduction defects. The cause of ASD is unknown. ASD accounts for about 6% to 8% of congenital heart defects and appears almost twice as often in females as in males, with a strong familial tendency . Altho ugh ASD is usually a benign defect during infancy and childhood, delayed development of symptoms and complications makes it one of the most common congenital heart defects diagnosed in adults. ASD is present in 4 of every 100,000 people. Symptoms usually develop before age 30. When no other congenital defect exists, the patient—especially if a child—may be asymptomatic. The prognosis is excellent in asymptomatic patients but poor in those with cyanosis caused by large, if the opening is large, higher pressure in the left atrium can shunt large amounts of blood into the right atrium, which can result in right heart volume overload, right atrial and ventricular enlar gement, as adults"
"Respiratory Disorders Introduction The respiratory system distributes air to the alveoli, where gas exchange—the addition of oxygen (O2) and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from pulmonary capillary blood—takes place. Certain specialized structures within this system play a vital role in preparing air for use by the body . The nose, for example, contains vestibular hairs that filter the air and an extensive vascular network that warms it. The nose also contains a layer of goblet cells and a moist mucosal surface; water vapor enters the airstream from this mucosal surface to saturate inspired air as it’s warmed in the upper airways. Ciliated mucosa in the posterior portion of the nose and nasopharynx as well as major portions of the tracheobronchial tree propel particles deposited by impaction or gravity to the oropharynx, where the particles are swallowed. EXTERNAL RESPIRA TION The external component of respiration—ventilation or breathing—delivers inspired air to the lower respiratory tract and alveoli. Contraction and relaxation of the respiratory muscles move air into and out of the lungs. Ventilation begins with the contraction of the inspiratory muscles: the diaphragm (the major muscle of respiration) descends, while external intercostal muscles move the rib cage upward and outward. Air then enters the lungs in response to the pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs. The lungs adhere to the chest wall and diaphragmbecause of the vacuum create d within the pleural space. As the thorax expands, negative pressure is created in the intrapleural space, causing the lungs to also expand and draw in the warmed, humidified air. The accessory muscles of inspiration, which include the scalene and sternocleidomastoid muscles, raise the clavicles, upper ribs, and sternum. The accessory muscles aren’ t used in normal inspiration but may be used in some pathologic conditions. Normal expiration is passive; the inspiratory muscles cease to contract, the diaphragm rises, and the elastic recoil of the lungs causes the lungs to contract. These actions raise the pressure within the lungs abov e atmospheric pressure, movin g air from the lungs to the atmosphere. Active expiration causes pleural pressure to become less negative. (See Mechanics of ventilation , page 87.) Mechanics of V entilation Breathing results from differences between atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, as described below . Before inspiration, intrapulmonary pressure equals atmospheric pressure ( ∼760 mm Hg). Intrapleural pressure is 756 mm Hg. The intrapulmonary atmospheric pressure gradient pulls air into the lungs until the two pressures are equal. During inspiration, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles contract,During normal expiration, the diaphragm slowly relaxes and the lungs and thorax passively return to resting size and enlar ging the thorax vertically and horizontally . As the thorax expands, intrapleural pressure decreases and the lungs expand to fill the enlar ging thoracic cavity . position. During deep or forced expiration, contraction of internal intercostal and abdominal muscles reduces thoracic volume. Lung and thorax compression raises intrapulmonary pressure above atmospheric pressure. An adult lung contains an estimated 300 million alveoli; each alveolus is supplied by many capillaries. To reach the capillary lumen, O2 must cross the alveolocapillary membrane, which consists of an alveolar epithelial cell, a thin interstitial space, the capillary basement membrane, and the capillary endothelial cell membrane. The O2 tension of air entering the respiratory tract is approximately 150 mm Hg. In the alveoli, inspired air mixes with CO2 and water vapor , lowering the O2 pressure to approximately 100 mm Hg. Because alveolar partial pressure of O2 is higher than that present in mixed venous blood entering the pulmonary capillaries ( ∼ 40 mm Hg), O2 diffuses across the alveolocapillary membrane into the blood. O2 AND CO2 TRANSPORT AND INTERNAL RESPIRA TION Circulating blood delivers O2 to the cells of the body for metabolism and transports metabolic wastes and CO2 from the tissues back to the lungs. When oxygenated arterial blood reaches tissue capillaries, O2 diffuses from the blood into the cells because of the O2 tension  gradien t. The amount of O2 available is determined by the concentration of hemoglobin (Hb; the principalcarrier of O2), the percentage of O2 saturation of the Hb, regional blood flow, arterial O2 content, and cardiac output. Internal (cellular) respiration occurs as a part of cellular metabolism, which can take place with O2 (aerobic) or without O2 (anaerobic). The most efficient method for providing fuel (high-ener gy compounds such as adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) for cellular reactions is aerobic metabolism, which produces CO2 and water in addition to ATP. Anaerobic metabolism is less efficient becaus e a cell produce s only a limited amount of ATP and yields lactic acid as well as CO2 as a metabolic by-product. Because circulation is continuous, CO2 doesn’ t normally accumulate in tissues. CO2 produced during cellular respiration diffuses from tissues into regional capillar ies and is transported by systemic venous circulation. When CO2 reaches the alveolar capillaries, it diffuses into the alveoli, where the partial pressure of CO2 is lower; CO2 is removed from the alveoli during exhalation. MECHANISMS OF CONTROL The central nervous system’ s (CNS) control of respiration lies in the respiratory cente r, located in the lateral medulla oblongata of the brainstem. Impulses travel down the phrenic nerves to the diaphragm, and down the intercostal nerves to the intercostal muscles, where the impulses change the rate and depth of respiration. The inspiratory and expiratory centers, located in the posterior medulla, establish the involuntary rhythm of the breathing pattern. Apneustic and pneumotaxic centers in the pons influence the pattern of breathing. Stimulation of the lower pontine apneustic center (e.g., by trauma, tumor , or stroke) produces forceful inspiratory gasps alternating with weak expiration. The apneustic center continually excites the medullary inspiratory center and thus facilitates inspiration. Signals from the pneumot axic center as well as afferent  impulses from the vagus nerve inhibit the apneustic center and “turn off” inspiration. The apneustic pattern doesn’ t occur if the vagus nerves are intact. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa O2), pH, and pH of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) influence output from the respiratory center . When CO2 enters the CSF, the pH of CSF falls, stimu lating central chemoreceptors to increase ventilation.The respiratory  center also receives information from peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. These chemoreceptors respond primarily to decreased PaO2 but also to decreased pH. The peripheral chemoreceptors have little control over respirations until the PaO2 is less than 60 mm Hg. During exercise, stretch recepto rs in lung tissue and the diaphragm prevent overexpansion of the lungs. During swallowing, the cortex can interrupt automatic control of ventilation. During sleep, respiratory drive may fluctuate, producing hypoventilation and periods of apnea. External sensations, drugs, chronic hypercapnia, and changes in body temperature can also alter the respiratory pattern. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Diagnostic tests evaluate physiologic characteristics and pathologic states within the respiratory tract. Noninvasive tests include: Chest X-ray shows such conditions as atelectasis, pleural ef fusion, infiltrates, pneumothorax, lesions, mediastinal shifts, pulmonary edema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Computed tomography (or CT) scan provides a three-dimensional picture that’s 100 times more sensitive than a chest X-ray . Magnetic resonance imaging identifies obstructed arteries and tissue perfusion, but movement of the heart and lungs reduces the image’ s clarity . Sputum specimen analysis assesses sputum quantity , color , viscosity , and odor; microbiological stains and culture of sputum can identify infectious organisms; and cytologic preparations can detect respiratory tract neoplasms. Sensitivity tests determine antibiotic sensitivity and resistance. Pulmonary function tests (or PFT s) measure lung volume, flow rates, and compliance. Normal values, individualized by body stature, ethnicity , and age, are reported in percentage of the normal predicted value. Static measurements are volume measurements that include tidal volume, volume of air contained in a normal breath; functional residual capacity , volume of air remaining in the lungs after normal expiration; vital capacity , volume of air that can be exhaled after maximal inspiration; residual volume, air remaining in the lungs after maximal expiration; and total lung capacity (TLC), volume of air in the lungs after maximal inspiration. Dynamic measurements characterize the movement of air into and out of the lungsand show changes in lung mechanics. They include measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), maximum volume of air that can be expired in 1 second from TLC; maximal voluntary ventilation, volume of air that can be expired in 1 minute with the patient’ s maximum voluntary effort; and forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal volume of air that the patient can exhale from TLC. (Peak flow rate, which can be obtained at the bedside, is also a dynamic measurement of pulmonary function.) Methacholine challenge is one method of assessing airway responsiveness and is used to determine a diagnosis of asthma. Exercise stress test evaluates the ability to transport O2 and remove CO2 with increasing metabolic demands. Polysomnography can diagnose sleep disorders. Lung scan (ventilation–perfusion or scintiphotography scan) demonstrates ventilation and perfusion patterns. It’ s used primarily to evaluate pulmonary embolus. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis assesses gas exchange. Decreased Pa O2 may indicate hypoventilation, ventilation–perfusion mismatch, or shunting of blood away from gas exchange sites. Increased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa CO2) reflects marked ventilation–perfusion mismatch or hypoventilation; decreased Pa CO2 reflects increased alveolar ventilation. Changes in pH may reflect metabolic or respiratory dysfunction. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive assessment of arterial oxygen saturation. Capnography may be used either transcutaneously or in ventilator circuit to determine Pa CO2 trends. Invasive tests include: Bronchoscopy permits direct visualization of the trachea and mainstem, lobar , segmental, and subsegmental bronchi. It may be used to localize the site of lung hemorrhage, visualize masses in these airways, and collect respiratory tract secretions. Brush biopsy may be used to obtain specimens from the lungs for microbiological stains, culture, and cytology . Lesion biopsies may be performed by using small forceps under direct visualization (when present in the proximal airways) or with the aid of fluoroscopy (when present distal to regions of direct visualization). Bronchoscopy can also be used to clear secretions and remove foreign bodies.Thoracentesis permits removal of pleural fluid for analysis. Pleural biopsy obtains pleural tissue for histologic examination and culture. Pulmonary artery angiography , the injection of dye into the pulmonary artery , can locate pulmonary embolism. This is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary emboli. Positron emission tomography scan uses a short-life radionuclide. Increased uptake of the substance is seen in malignant cells. ASSESSMENT Assessment of the respiratory system begins with a thorough patient history . Ask the patient to describe his or her respiratory problem. How long has he or she had it? How long does each attack last? Does one attack differ from another? Does any activity in particular bring on an attack or make it worse? What relieves the symptoms? Always ask whether the patient was or is a smoker , what and how often he or she smoked or smokes, and how long he or she smoked or has been smoking. Record this information in pack years —the number of packs of cigarettes per day multiplied by the number of smoking years. Remember to ask about the patient’ s occupation, hobbies, and travel; some of these activities may involve exposure to toxic or allergenic substances. If the patient has dyspnea, ask if it occurs during activity or at rest. What position is the patient in when dyspnea occurs? How far can he or she walk? How many flights of stairs can he or she climb? Has his or her exercise tolerance been decreasing? Can he or she relate dyspnea to allergies or environmental conditions? Does it occur only at night, during sleep? If the patient has a cough, ask about its severity , persistence, and duration; ask if it produces sputum and, if so, how much and what kind. Have the patient’ s cough habits and character of sputum changed recently? PHYSICAL EXAMINA TION Use inspection skills to check for clues to respiratory disease, beginning with the patie nt’s general appearance. If he or she is frail or cachec tic, he or she may have a chronic disease that has impaired his or her appetite. If he or she is diaphoretic, restless, or irritab le or protective of a painful body part, he or she may be in acute distress. Also, look for behavior changes that may indicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia. Confusion, lethar gy, bizarre behavior , or quiet sleep from  which the patie nt can’t be aroused may point to hypercapnia.Watch for marked cyanosis, indicated by bluish or ashen skin (usually best seen on the lips, tongue, earlo bes, and nail beds), which may be due to hypoxemia or poor tissue perfusion. Assess chest shape and symmetry at rest and during ventilation. Increased anteroposterior diameter (“barrel chest”) characterizes emphysema. Kyphoscoliosis also alters chest configuration, which in turn restricts breathing. Asses s respiratory excursion and observe for accessory muscle use during breathing. The use of upper chest and neck muscles is normal only during physical stress. Observe the rate and pattern of breathing because certain disord ers produce characteristic changes in breathing patterns. For example, an acute respiratory disorder can produce tachypnea (rapid, shallow breathing) or hyperpnea (increased rate and depth of breathing); intracranial lesions  can produce Cheyne–Stokes and Biot’ s respirations; increased intracranial pressure can result in central hyperventilation  and apneustic or ataxic breathing; metabolic disorders can cause Kussmaul’ s respirations; and airway obstruction can lead to prolonged forceful expiration and pursed-lip breathing. Also observe posture and carriage. A patient with COPD, for example, usually supports rib cage movement by placing his or her arms on the sides of a chair to increase expansion and lean forward during exhal ation to help expel air . Palpation of the chest wall detects areas of tenderness, masses, changes in fremitus (palpable vocal vibrations), or crepitus (air in subcutaneous tissues). To assess chest excursion and symmetry , place your hands in a horizontal position, bilatera lly on the posterior chest, with your thumbs pressed lightly against the spine, creating folds in the skin. As the patient takes a deep breath, your thumbs should move quickly and equally away from the spine. Repeat this with your hands placed anteriorly , at the costal margins (lower lobes) and clavicles (apice s). Unequal movement indicates differences in expansion, seen in atelectasis, diaphragm or chest wall muscle disease, or splinting due to pain. Percussion should detect resona nce over lung fields that aren’ t covered by bony structures  or the heart.  A dull sound on percussio n may mean consolidation or pleural disease. (See Characterizing and interpr eting percussion sounds .) Characterizing and Interpr eting Per cussion Sounds Percussion may produce several kinds of sounds. Known as flat, dull, resonant, hyperresonant, or tympanic, these sounds indicate the location and density of various structures. During percussion, determining other tonal characteristics, such as pitch, intensity , and quality , also will help identify respirat ory structure. Use this chart as a guide to interpreting percussion sounds. Characteristic Sound Pitch Intensity Quality Implications Flatness High Soft Extremely dullThese sounds are normal over the sternum. Over the lung, they may indicate atelectasis or pleural ef fusion. Dullness Medium Medium Thudlike Normal over the liver , heart, and diaphragm, these sounds over the lung may point to pneumonia, tumor , atelectasis, or pleural ef fusion. Resonance Low Moderate to loudHollow When percussed over the lung, these sounds are normal. Hyperresonance Lower than resonanceVery loud Booming These are normal findings with percussion over a child’ s lung. Over an adult’ s lung, these findings may indicate emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, or pneumothorax. Tympany High Loud Musical, drumlikeOver the stomach, these are normal findings; over the lung, they suggest tension pneumothorax. Auscultation normally detects soft, vesicular breath sounds throughout most of the lung fields. Absent or adventitious breath sounds  may indicate fluid in small airways or interstitial lung disease (crackles), secretions in moderate and lar ge airways (rhonchi), and airflow obstruction (wheezes). SPECIAL RESPIRA TORY CARE The hospitalized patient with respiratory disease may require an artificial upper airway , chest tubes, chest physiotherapy , and supervision of mechanical ventilation. In cardiopulmonary arrest, establishing an airway always takes precedence. In a patient with this condition, airway obstruction usually results when the tongue slides back and blocks the posterior pharynx.  The head-tilt method or, in suspected or confirmed cervical fracture or arthritis, the jaw-thrust maneuver can immediately push the tongue forward, relieving such obstruction. Endotracheal (ET) intubation and, sometimes, a tracheotomy may be necessary . CHEST TUBES An important procedure in patients with respiratory disease is chest tube drainage, which  removes air or fluid from the pleural space. This allows the collapsed lung to re-expand to fill the evacuated pleural space. Chest drainage also allows removal of pleural fluid for culture. Chest tubes are commonly used after thoracic surgery, penetrating chest wounds, pleural effusion, and empyema. They’re also used for evacuation of pneumothorax, hydrothorax, or hemothorax. Sometimes chest tubes are used to instill sclerosing drugs into the pleural space to prevent recurrent malignant pleural ef fusions. Commonly , the chest tube is placed in the sixth or seventh  intercostal space, in the axillary region. Occasionally , in pneumothorax, the tube is placed in the second or third intercostal space, in the midclavicular region. Follow these guidelines when caring for a patient with a chest tube: Monitor changes in suction pressure. Make sure that all connections in the system are tight and secured with tape. Never clamp the chest tube unless checking for air leaks or changing the drainage system. Record the amount, color , and consistency of drainage. W atch for signs of shock, such as tachycardia and hypotension, if drainage is excessive. Encourage the patient to cough and breathe deeply every hour to enhance lung expansion. Additionally , if a water seal–wet suction system is in place: Check for fluctuation in the water -seal chamber as the patient breathes. Normal fluctuations of 2″ to 4″ (about 5 to 10 cm) reflect pressure changes in the pleural space during respiration. Watch for intermittent bubbling in the water -seal chamber . This bubbling occurs normally when the system is removing air from the pleural cavity . Absence of bubbling indicates that the pleural space has sealed. Check the water level in the suction-control chamber . If necessary , add sterile water to bring the level to the ordered level. Check for gentle bubbling in the suction-control chamber , which indicates that the proper suction level has been reached.If a dry-suction system is in place, check that the rotary dry-suc tion control dial is turned to the ordered suction mark and verify that the appropriate indicator is present, indicating that the desired amount of suction is applied. VENTILA TOR METHODS Mechanical ventilators are typically used for CNS problems, hypoxemia, or failure of the normal bellows action provided by the diaphragm  and rib cage. Positive-pressure ventilators cause inspiration while increasing tidal volume (VT). The inspiratory cycles of these ventilators may vary in volume, pressure, time, or frequency . For example, a volume-cycled ventilator—the type most commonly used—d elivers a preset volume of air each time, regardless of the amount of lung resistance. A pressure-cycled ventilator generates flow until the machin e reaches a preset pressure regardless of the volume delivered or the time required to achieve the pressure. A time-cycled ventilator gener ates flow for a preset amount of time. A high-frequency ventilator uses high respirator y rates and low VT to maintain alveolar ventilation. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used to retain a certain amount of pressure in the lungs at the end of expiration. By keeping small airways and alveoli open with this method, functional residual capacity is increased and oxygenation is improved. Implement strategies to prevent ventilator -associated pneumonia (V AP) and plan to remove the patient from ventilator support as soon as the cause of respiratory failure has resolv ed. (See Preventing ventilator -associated pneumonia , page 92.) Seve ral weaning methods are used. The patient may be taken off the ventilator and supplied with a T-piece (ET tube O2 adapter) that provides O2 and humidification. The patient then breathes spontaneousl y without the ventilator for gradually increasing periods. PREVENTION   PREVENTING VENTILA TOR-ASSOCIA TED PNEUMONIA Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of death among all hospital-acquired infections. VAP also prolongs time spent on the ventilator , length of critical care unit (CCU) stay, and length of hospital stay after dischar ge from the CCU. Research has show n that the mortality rate due to VAP can be reduced by early recognition of pneumonia and consistent application of evidence-based practices. The Ventilator Bundle is a group of interventions related to ventilator care that, when implemen ted together , achieve significantly better outco mes than when implemented individually . The key components of the Ventilator Bundle include: elevating the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees interrupting sedation daily and assessing the readiness to extubate instituting peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis instituting deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis providing daily oral care with chlorhexidine Various other best practices can be combined with the bundle to prevent VAP. They include: adhering to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or W orld Health Or ganization hand hygiene guidelines to prevent the spread of infection using noninvasive ventilatory support, such as bilevel positive-airway ventilation instead of endotracheal (ET) intubation and mechanical ventilation, to eliminate the risk of V AP using the oral route instead of the nasal route for ET intubation to prevent sinusitis maintaining ET tube cuf f pressure at 20 cm or more to prevent aspiration using a cuf fed ET tube with in-line and subglottic suctioning to prevent secretion aspiration avoiding gastric distention to reduce the risk for aspiration avoiding unexplained extubation and reintubation to prevent secretion aspiration minimizing equipment contamination (by removing condensate from ventilator circuits, keeping the circuit closed during removal, changing the ventilator circuit only when visibly soiled or malfunctioning, and disinfecting and storing respiratory equipment properly) to prevent airway contamination teaching the patient and family about measures to prevent V AP and involving them in monitoringWith intermittent mandatory ventilation, the ventilator provides a specific number of breaths, and the patient is able to breathe spontaneously between ventilator breath s. The frequency of ventilator breaths is gradua lly decreased until the patient can breathe on his or her own. Pressure support ventilation, in which the patient receives a preset pressure boost with each spontaneous breath, has proved effective. Vital signs, ABG levels, physical findings, and subjective symptoms should be monitored periodically during weaning to assess respiratory status. Chest Physiotherapy In respiratory conditions marked by excessive accumulation of secretions in the lungs, chest physiotherapy may enhance removal of secretions. Chest physiotherapy includes chest assessment, effective breathing and coughing exercises, postural drainage, percussion, vibration, and evaluation of the therapy’ s effectiveness. Before initiating treatment, review  X-rays and physical assessment findings to locate areas of secretions. Deep breathing maintains diaphragm use, increases negative intrathoracic pressure, and promotes venous return; it’ s especially important when pain or dressings restrict chest movement. An incentive spirometer can provide positive visual reinforcement to promote deep breathing. Pursed-lip breathing is used primarily in obstructive disease to slow expiration and prevent small airway collapse. Such breathing slows air through smaller bronchi, maintaining positive pressure and preventing collapse of small airways and resultant air trapping. Segmental breathing or lateral costal breathing is used after lung resection and for localized disorders. Place your hand over the lung area on the affected side. Instruct the patient to try to push that portion of the chest against your hand on deep inspiration. Y ou should be able to feel this with your hand. Coughing that’ s controlled and staged gradually increases intrathoracic pressure, reducing pain and bronchospasm of explosive coughing. When wound pain prevents ef fective coughing, splint the wound with a pillow , towel, or your hand during coughing exercises. Postural drainage uses gravity to drain secretions into lar ger airways, where they can be expectorated. This technique is used in the patient with copious or tenacious secretions. Before performing postural drainage, auscultate the patient’ s chest and review chest X-rays to determine the bestposition for maximum drainage. T o prevent vomiting, schedule postural drainage at least 1 hour after meals. Percussion moves air against the chest wall, enhancing the ef fectiveness of postural drainage by loosening lung secretions. Percussion is contraindicated in severe pain, extreme obesity , cancer that has metastasized to the ribs, crushing chest injuries, bleeding disorders, spontaneous pneumothorax, spinal compression fractures, and in patients with temporary pacemakers. Vibration can be used with percussion or alone when percussion is contraindicated. PEEP therapy maintains positive pressure in airways, preventing small airway collapse. Before and after chest physiotherapy , auscultate the patient’ s lung fields and assess for sputum production to evaluate the ef fectiveness of therapy . Congenital and Pediatric Disorders RESPIRA TORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also called hyaline membrane disease , is the most comm on cause of neonatal mortality . In the United States alone, it kills 40,000 neonates every year. RDS occurs in premature neonates and, if untreated, is fatal within 72 hours of birth in up to 14% of neonates weighing less than 5½ lb (2.5 kg). Aggressive management using  mechanical ventilation can improve the prognosis, but some surviving neonates may develop some degree of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Causes and Incidence Although airways and alveoli of a neonate’ s respiratory system are present by 27 weeks’ gestation, the intercostal muscles are weak, and the alveolar capillary system  is immature. The preterm neonate with RDS develops widespread alveolar collapse because of a lack of surfactant, a lipoprotein present in alveoli and respiratory bronchioles. The surfactant lowers surface tension and helps prevent alveolar collapse. This surfactant deficiency results in wides pread atelectasis, which leads to inadequate alveolar ventilation with shunting of blood through collapsed areas of lung, causing hypoxemia and acidosis.RDS occurs almost exclusive ly in neonates born before 37 weeks’ gestation (in 60% of those born before the 28th week). The incidence is greatest in those with birth weights of 1,000 to 1,500 g. Infants of diabetic mothers, those born by cesarea n delivery , second-born twins, infants with perinatal asphyxia, and those delivered suddenly after antepartum hemorrhage are more commonly af fected. Pathophysiology The lack of surfactant coating the alveoli reduces the available pulmonary surface and decreases the area for gas exchange. Worsening hypercapnia and hypoxia cause metabolic and respiratory acidosis leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilation. Damage to the endothelial and alveolar cells results from the ongoing hypoxia. The subseq uent vascular disruption leads to plasma leakage into the alveolar spaces, layering of fibrin and necrotic cells creating hyaline membranes. These membran es impede the exchange of gases across the alveolar surface. Complications Pneumothorax Pneumomediastinum Pneumopericardium BPD Intraventricular bleed Hemorrhage into lungs after surfactant use Retinopathy of prematurity (or ROP) Delayed mental development or mental retardation Signs and Symptoms Although a neonate with RDS may breathe normally at first, they usually develop rapid, shallow respirat ions within minutes or hours of birth, with intercostal, subcostal, or sternal retractions; nasal flaring; and audible expiratory grunting. This grunting is a natural compensatory mechanism designed to produce PEEP and prevent further alveolar collapse. Severe disease is marked by apnea, bradycardia, and cyan osis (from hypoxemia, left-to-right shunting through the foramen ovale, or right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting through atelectatic regions of the lung). Otherclinical features include pallor , frothy sputum, and low body temperature as a result of an immature nervous system and the absence of subcutaneous fat. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS  Signs of r espiratory distr ess in a pr ematur e neonate during the first few hours of life str ongly suggest RDS, but a chest X-ray and ABG analysis ar e needed to confirm the diagnosis. Chest X-ray may be normal for the first 6 to 12 hours (in 50% of neonates with RDS), but 24 hours after birth it will show the characteristic ground- glass appearance and air bronchograms. ABG analysis shows decreased Pa O2; normal, decreased, or increased PaCO2; and decreased pH (from respiratory or metabolic acidosis or both). Chest auscultation reveals normal or diminished air entry and crackles (rare in early stages). When a cesarean birth is necessary before 36 weeks’ gestation, amniocentesis enables the determination of the lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol. An L/S ratio of more than 2:1 and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol decrease the likelihood of RDS. Treatment Treatment of an infant with RDS requires vigorous respiratory support. Warm, humidified, oxygen-enriched gases are administered by oxygen hood or, if such treatment fails, by mechanical ventilation. Severe cases may require mechan ical ventilation  with PEEP or continuous positive-airway pressure (CPAP), administered by nasal prongs or, when necessary , check for arterial hypotension or abnormal central venous pressure. W atch for complications, such as infection, thrombosis, or decreased circulation to the legs. If the neonate has a transcutaneous oxygen monitor , change the site of the lead placement every 2 to 4 hours. To evaluate progress, assess skin color , rate and depth of respirations, severity of retractions, nostril flaring, frequency of expiratory grunting, frothing at the lips, on the basis of findings. Mechanical ventilation in neonates is usually done in a pressure-limited mode rather than in the volume-limited mode used in adults. When the neonate is on mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax,0, O2"
"Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Introduction Metabolism is the physiologic process that allows cells to transform food into energy and continually rebuild body cells. Metabolism has two phases: catabolism and anabolism. In catabolism , the energy-producing phase of metabolism, the body breaks down large food molecules into smaller ones; in anabolism , the tissue-building phase, the body converts small molecules into larger ones (such as antibo dies to keep the body capable  of fighting infection). Both phases are accomplished by means of a chemical process using energy. A wide range of nutrients is metabolized to meet the body’ s needs. (See Essential nutrients and their functions , page 487.) ELDER TIP  A person’ s protein, vitamin, and mineral r equir ements usually r emain the same as they age, although calorie needs decline. Diminished activity may lower ener gy requir ements by almost 200 calories/day for men and women ages 51 to 75, 400 calories/day for women older than age 75, and 500 calories/day for men older than age 75 . Essential nutrients and their functions Nutrients are required for the body to work properly and avoid disease. Nutrients Functions Nutrients Functions Carbohydrates Energy source Fats and essential fatty acidsEnergy source; essential for growth, normal skin, and membranes Proteins and amino acidsSynthesis of all body proteins, growth, and tissue maintenance Water-soluble vitamins Ascorbic acid (C) Thiamine (B1) Riboflavin (B2) Niacin Vitamin B12 Folic acidCollagen synthesis, wound healing, antioxidation Coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism Coenzyme in energy metabolism Coenzyme in carbohydrate, fat, energy metabolism, and tissue metabolism Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid synthesis; erythrocyte formation Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism; heme and hemoglobin formation; DNA synthesis; lowering homocysteine levels Fat-soluble vitamins Vitamin A Vitamin D Vitamin E Vitamin KVision in dim light, mucosal epithelium integrity , tooth development, endocrine function Regulation of calcium and phosphate absorption and metabolism; renal phosphate clearance; musculoskeletal function Antioxidation; essential for muscle, liver , and red blood cell integrity Blood clotting (catalyzes synthesis of prothrombin by liver); skeletal function CARBOHYDRA TES: PRIMAR Y ENERGY SOURCE The body gets most of its energy by metabolizing carbohydrates , especially glucose. Glucose catabolism proceeds in three phases: Glycolysis , a series of chemical reactions, converts glucose molecules into pyruvic or lactic acid. The citric acid cycle  removes ionized hydrogen atoms from pyruvic acid and produces carbon dioxide. Oxidative phosphorylation  traps ener gy from the hydrogen electrons and combines the hydrogen ions and electrons with oxygen to form water and the common form of biological ener gy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other essentia l processes in carbohydrate metabolism include glycogenesis—the formation of glycogen, a storage form of glucose— which occurs when cells become saturated with glucose-6-phosphate (an intermediate product of glycol ysis); glycogenolysis, the reverse process,which converts glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate in muscle cells and liberates free glucose in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, or “new” glucose formation from protein amino acids or fat glycerols. A comp lex interplay of hormonal and neural controls regulates glucose metabolism. Hormone secretions of five endocrine glands dominate this regulatory function: Alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete glucagon, which increases the blood glucose level by stimulating phosphorylase activity to accelerate liver glycogenolysis. Beta cells of the islets of Langerhans secrete the glucose-regulating hormone insulin, which assists in glucose transport across cell membranes and storage of excess glucose as fat. The adrenal medulla, as a physiologic response to stress, secretes epinephrine, which stimulates liver and muscle glycogenolysis to increase the blood glucose level. Corticotropin and glucocorticoids also increase blood glucose levels. Glucocorticoids accelerate gluconeogenesis by promoting the flow of amino acids to the liver , where they’re synthesized into glucose. Human growth hormone (hGH) limits the fat storage and favors fat catabolism; consequently , it inhibits carbohydrate catabolism and thus raises blood glucose levels. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormone have mixed ef fects on carbohydrate metabolism and may raise or lower blood glucose levels. FATS: CA TABOLISM AND ANABOLISM The breaking up of triglycerides— lipolysis —yields fatty acids and glycerol. Beta oxidation breaks down fatty acids into acetyl coenzyme A, which can then enter the citric acid cycle; glycerol can also under go gluconeogenesis or enter the glycolytic pathways  to produce energy. Conversely , lipogenesis is the chemical formation of fat from excess carbohydrates and proteins or from the fatty acids and glycerol products of lipolysis. Adipose tissue is the primary storage site for excess fat and thus is the greatest source of energy reserve. Certain  unsaturated fatty acids are necessary for the synthesis of vital body compounds. Because  the body can’t produce these essential fatty acids, they must be provided through diet. Insulin, hGH, catecholamines,corticotropin, and glucocorticoids control fat metabolism in an inverse relationship with carbohydrate metabolism; large amounts of carbohydrates promote fat storage, and deficie ncy of available carbohydrates promotes fat breakdown for ener gy needs. PROTEINS: ANABOLISM The primary process in protein metabolism is anabolism. Catabolism is relegated to a supporting role in protein metabolism—a reversal of the roles played by these two processes in carbohydrate and fat metabolisms. By synthesizing proteins—the tissue-building foods—the body derives substances essential for life (such as plasma proteins) and can reproduce, control cell growth, and repair itself. However , when carbohyd rates or fats are unav ailable as energy sources, or when energy demands are exceedingly high, protein catabolism conver ts protein into an available energy source. Protein metabolism consists of many processes, including: Deamination —a catabolic and ener gy-producing process occurring in the liver with the splitting of f of the amino acid to form ammonia and a keto acid Transamination —anabolic conversion of keto acids to amino acids Urea formation —a catabolic process occurring in the liver , producing urea, the end product of protein catabolism The male hormone testosterone and hGH stimulate protein anabolism; corticotropin prompts secretion of glucocorticoids, which, in turn, facilitate protein catabolis m. Normally , the rate of protein anabolism equals the rate of protein catabolism—a condition known as nitrogen balance  (because ingested nitrogen equals nitroge n waste excreted in urine, feces, and sweat). When excessive  catabolism causes the amount of nitrogen excreted to exceed the amount ingested, a state of negative nitrogen balance  exists— usually the result of starvation and cachexia or sur gical stress. FLUID AND ELECTROL YTE BALANCE A critical component of metabo lism is fluid and electrolyte balance. Water is an essential body substance and constitutes almost 60% of an adult’ s body weight and more than 75% of a neonate’ s body weight. In both older and obese adults, the ratio of water to body weight drops; childr en and lean people have a higher proportion of water in their bodies.Body fluids can be classified as intracellular (or cellular) or extracellular . Intracellular fluid constitutes about 40% of total body weight and 60% of all body fluid; it contains large quantities of potassium and phosphates but very little sodium and chloride. Conversely , extracellular fluid (ECF) contains mostly  sodium and chloride but very little potassium and phosphates. Incorporating interstitial, cerebrospinal, intrao cular , and gastrointestinal (GI) fluids and plasma, ECF supplies cells with nutrients and other substances needed for cellular function. The many components of body fluids have the important function of preserving osmotic pressure and acid–base and anion–cation balance. Homeostasis is a stable state—t he equilibrium of chemical and physical properties of body fluid. Body fluids contain two kinds of dissolved substances: those that dissociate in solution (electrolytes) and those that don’t. For example, glucose, when dissolved in water , doesn’ t break down into smaller particles; but sodium chloride dissociates in solution into sodium cations (+) and chlori de anions (−). The composition of these electrolytes in body fluids is electrically balanced so the positively charged ions (cations: sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium) equal the negatively charged ions (anions : chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate,  phosphate, proteinate, and carbonic and other organic acids). Although these particles are present in relatively low concentrations, any deviation from their normal levels can have profound physiologic ef fects. ELDER TIP  Institutionalized older people ar e at particularly high risk for dehydration because of their diminished thirst per ception and any combination of physical, cognitive, speech, mobility , and visual impairment . In homeostasis—an ever-changing but balanced state—water and electrolytes and other solutes move continually between cellular and extracellular compartments. Such motion is made possible by semipermeable membranes that allow diffusion, filtration, and active transport. Diffusion  refers to the movement of particles or molecules from an area of great er concentration to one of lesser concentration. Normally , particles move randomly and constantly until the concentrations within given solutions are equal. Diffusion also depends on permeability , electrical gradient, and pressure gradient. Particles, however , can’t diffuse against any of these gradients without energy and a carrier substance (activ e transport).ATP is released  from cells to aid particles needing energy to pass through the cell membrane. The diffusion of water from a solution of low concentration to one of high concentration is called osmosis . The pressure that develops when a selectively perm eable cell membrane separates solutions of different strengths of concentrations is known as osmotic pressur e, expressed in terms of osmoles or milliosmole s (mOsm). Osmotic activity is described in terms of osmolality —the osmotic pull exerted by all particles per unit of water , expressed in mOsm/kg of water—or osmolarity , when expressed in mOsm/L of solution. The normal range of body fluid osmolality is 285 to 295 mOsm/kg. Solutions of 50 mOsm above or below the high and low points of this normal range exert little or no osmotic effect (iso-osmolality).  A solution below 240 mOsm contains a lower particle concentration than plasma (hypo-osmolar), whereas a solution over 340 mOsm has a higher particle concentration than plasma (hyperosmolar). Rapid I.V. administration of iso-osmolar solutions to patients  who are debilitated, are very old or very young, or have cardia c or renal insuf ficiency could lead to ECF volume overload and induce pulmonary edema and heart failure because particulate concentration is the same as plasma, so fluid shifting into and out of cells will occur . Continuous I.V. administration  of hypo-osmolar solutions decreases serum osmolality and leads to excess intracellular fluid volume (water intoxication), whereas continu ous I.V. administration of hyperosmolar solutions results in intracellular dehydration, increased serum osmolality and, eventually , ECF volume deficit due to excessive urinary excretion. These states occur because of fluid diffusion and the cell’s attempt to balance the particulate concentrations inside and outside the cell. REGULA TION OF PH Primarily through the complex chemical regulation of carbonic acid by the lungs and of base bicarbonate by the kidneys, the body maintains the hydrogen ion concentration to keep the ECF pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Nutritional deficiency or excess, disease, injury , or metabolic disturbance can interfere with normal homeostatic mechanisms and raise pH (acidosis) or lower it (alkalosis).ASSESSING HOMEOST ASIS The goal of metabolism and homeostasis is to maintain the complex environment of ECF—the plasma—which nourishes and supports every body cell. This special environment is subject to multiple interlocking influences and readily reflects any disturbance in nutrition, chemical or fluid content, and osmotic press ure. Such disturbances can be detected by various laboratory tests. For example, measurements of albumin, prealbumin, and other blood proteins; electrolyte concentration; enzyme and antibody levels; and urine and blood chemistry levels (lipoproteins, glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, and creatinine-height index [CHI]) reflect the state of metabolism, homeostasis, and nutrition throughout the body . (See Laboratory tests: Assessing nutritional status , page 490.) Results of such laboratory tests, of course, supplement the information obtained from dietary history and physical examination— which offer gross clinical information about the quality , quantity , and efficiency of metabolic processes. To support clinical information, anthropometry , height-weight ratio, and skinfold thickness determinations specifically define tissue nutritional status. Laboratory tests: Assessing nutritional status Blood and urine tests provide the most precise data about nutritional status, often revealing nutritio nal problems before they’re clinically apparent. The list below explains some common tests and what their results mean. Serum V itamins and Minerals Vitamin and mineral deficiencies commonly screened for include deficiencies in A, B, B12, folic acid, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, riboflavin and, sometimes, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, and other minerals. Serum Nutrients Glucose levels help assess suspected diabetes or hypoglycemia. Glucose may be elevated with stress, acromegaly , Cushing syndrome, corticosteroid use, liver disease,  sepsis, or overfeeding. Glucose may be decreased with fluid overload , adrenal insuf ficiency , liver disease, severe sepsis, insulinoma, or pancreatic disorders. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels help dif ferentiate the type of hyperlipoproteinemia. Nitrogen Balance A negative nitrogen balance indicates inadequate intake of protein or calories. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Decreased levels can occur in protein-calorie malnutrition, iron deficiency , overhydration, hemo rrhage, and hemolytic disease; elevated levels in dehydration, polycythemia, and folate and vitamin B12 deficiency . Serum Albumin Reduced levels may indicate overhydration or visceral protein depletion because of GI disease, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome. Elevated levels occur in dehydration. Creatinine-Height Index (Chi) This calculated value reflects muscle mass and estimates muscle protein depletion. Redu ced CHI may indicate protein-calorie malnutrition or impaired renal function. Serum Pr ealbumin This carrier protein for thyrox ine is a sensitive indicator of visceral protein. Total L ymphocyte Count This provides an indication of immune status. Counts are low in malnutrition and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The following measures can help you maintain your patient’ s homeostasis: Obtain a complete dietary history and nutritional assessment, including weight history and GI symptoms, to determine if carbohydrate, fat,protein, vitamin, mineral, and water intake are adequate for ener gy production and for tissue repair and growth. Remember that during periods of rapid tissue synthesis (growth, pregnancy , healing), protein needs increase. Consult a dietitian about any patient who may be malnourished because of malabsorption syndromes, renal or hepatic disease, or clear -liquid diets or who may possibly receive nothing by mouth for more than 5 days. Planned meals that provide adequate carbohydrates, fats, and protein are necessary for convalescence. Supplementary carbohydrates are often needed to spare protein and achieve a positive nitrogen balance. Accurately record intake and output to assess fluid balance (this includes intake of oral liquids or I.V . solutions and urine, gastric, and stool output). Weigh the patient daily—at the same time, with the same-type clothing, and on the same scale. Remember , a weight loss of 2.2 lb (1 kg) is equivalent to the loss of 1 L of fluid. Observe the patient closely for insensible water or unmeasured fluid losses (such as through diaphoresis). Remember , fluid loss from the skin and lungs (normally 900 mL/day) can reach as high as 2,000 mL/day from hyperventilation or tachypnea, thus increasing insensible water losses. ELDER TIP  Teach elderly patients and others vulnerable to fluid imbalances the importance of maintaining adequate fluid intake . Recognize I.V . solutions that are hypo-osmolar , such as 0.45% NaCl (half-normal saline solution). Iso-osmolar solutions include normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 5% dextrose in 0.2% NaCl, Ringer solutions, and 5% dextrose in water . (The latter acts like a hypotonic solution because dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving only free water .) Hyperosmolar solutions include 5% dextrose in normal saline solution, 10% dextrose in water , and 5% dextrose in Ringer lactate solution. When continuously administering hypo-osmolar solutions, watch for signs of water intoxication: headaches, behavior changes (confusion or disorientation), nausea, vomiting, rising blood pressure, and falling pulse rate.When continuously administering hyperosmolar solutions, be alert for signs of hypovolemia: thirst, dry mucous membranes, slightly falling blood pressure, rising pulse rate and respirations, low-grade fever (99° F [37.2° C]), and elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and BUN levels. Administer fluid cautiously , especially to the patient with cardiopulmonary or renal disease, and watch for signs of overhydration: constant and irritating cough, dyspnea, moist crackles, rising central venous pressure, and pitting edema (late sign). When the patient is in an upright position, neck and hand vein engor gement is a sign of fluid overload. ELDER TIP  Many older patients take drugs to tr eat a variety of conditions. Remember that drugs can affect the patient’ s nutritional status by altering nutrient absorption, metabolism, utilization, or excretion. Likewise, various foods, beverages, and mineral or vitamin supplements can affect the absorption and effectiveness of drugs. Be awar e of these potential interactions when evaluating the patient’ s medication r egimen and nutritional status . Nutritional Imbalance VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY A fat-so luble vitamin absorbe d in the GI tract, vitamin A maintains epithelial tissue and retinal function. Consequently , deficiency of this vitamin may result in night blindness, decreased color adjustment, keratinization of epithelial tissue, and poor bone growth. Healthy adults have adequate vitamin A reserves to last up to a year; children often don’ t. Causes and Incidence Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intake of foods high in vitamin A (liver, kidney , butter , milk, cream, cheese, and fortified margarine) or carotene, a precursor of vitamin A found in dark green leafy vegetables and yellow or orang e fruits and vegetables. (Six milligrams of beta-carotene is equal to 1 mg of vitamin A.) The recommended daily allowance for vitamin A is 3,000 IU for adult males and 2,310 IU for adult females.Less common causes of vitamin A deficiency include: malabsorption due to celiac disease, sprue, cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis, or habitual use of mineral oil as a laxative massive urinary excretion caused by cancer , tuberculosis, pneumonia, nephritis, or urinary tract infection decreased storage and transport of vitamin A due to hepatic disease Each year, more than 80,000 people worldwide—mostly children in underdeveloped countries—los e their sight from severe vitamin A deficiency . This condition is rare in the United States, although many disadvantaged children have substandard levels of vitamin A. With therapy , the chance of reversing symptoms of night blindness and milder conjunctival changes is excellent. When corneal damage is present, emer gency treatment is necessary . Pathophysiology Once ingested, provitamins A are released from proteins in the stomach. These retinyl esters are then hydrolyzed to retinol in the small intestine, because retinol is more efficient ly absorbed. Carotenoids are cleaved in the intestinal mucosa into molecules of retinaldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to retinol and then esterified to retinyl esters. The retinyl esters of retinoid and carotenoid origin are transported via micelles in the lymphatic drainage of the intestine to the blood and then to the liver as components of chylomicrons. In the body , 50% to 80% of vitamin A is stored in the liver, where it is bound to the cellular retinol-binding protein (RBP). The remaining vitamin A is deposited into adipose tissue, the lungs, and the kidneys as retinyl esters, most commonly as retinyl palmitate. Vitamin A can be mobilized from the liver to peripheral tissue by a process of deesterification of the retinyl esters. In blood, vitamin A is bound to RBP, which transports it as a complex with transthyretin. The hepatic synthesis of RBP is dependent on the presence of zinc and amino acids to maintain its narrow serum range of 40 to 50 μg/dL. Through a receptor - mediated proces s, the retinol is taken up by the peripheral tissues from the RBP-transthyretin complex. ComplicationCorneal damage Signs and Symptoms Typically , the first symptom of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness (nyctalopia), which usually becomes apparent when the patient enters a dark place or is caught in the glare of oncoming headlights while driving at night. This condition can progress to xerophthalmia, or drying of the conjunctivas, with development of gray plaques (Bitot spots); if unchecked, perforation, scarring, and blindness may result. Keratinization of epithelial tissue causes dry, scaly skin; follicular hyperkeratosis; and shrinking and hardening of the mucous memb ranes, possibly leading to infections of the eyes and the respiratory or genitourinary tract. An infant with severe vitamin A deficiency shows signs of failure to thrive and apathy , along with dry skin and corneal changes, which can lead to ulceration and rapid destruction of the cornea. Diagnosis Dietary history and typical ocular lesions suggest vitamin A deficiency . Carotene levels less than 40 μg/dL also suggest vitamin A deficiency , but they vary with seasonal ingestion of fruits and vegetables. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS  A serum level of vitamin A that falls below 10 μg/dL confirms the diagnosis. Levels between 10 and 19 μg/dL ar e also consider ed low , but the patient isn’ t likely to have developed significant symptoms . Treatment Mild conjunctival changes or night blindness requires vitamin A replacement in the form of cod liver oil or halibut liver oil. Acute deficiency requires aqueous vitamin A solution I.M., or oral tablets, especially when corneal changes have occurred. Therapy for underlying biliary obstructi on consists of administration of bile salts; for pancreatic insuf ficiency , pancreatin, or pancrelipase. Dry skin responds well to cream- based or petroleum-based products. In patients with chronic malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and in those with low dietary intake, prevention of vitamin A deficiency requires aqueous I.V . supplements or an oral water -miscible preparation.Special Considerations Administer oral vitamin A supplements with or after meals or parenterally , as indicated. W atch for signs of hypercarotenemia (orange coloration of the skin and eyes) and hypervitaminosis A (rash, hair loss, anorexia, transient hydrocephalus, and vomiting in children; bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly , diplopia, and irritability in adults). If these signs occur , discontinue supplements and notify the physician immediately . (Hypercarotenemia is relatively harmless; hypervitaminosis A may be toxic.) PREVENTION  Because vitamin A deficiency usually r esults fr om dietary insufficiency , provide nutritional counseling. T ell the patient that vitamin A comes fr om animal sour ces, such as eggs, meat, milk, cheese, cr eam, liver , kidney , and cod and halibut fish oil, but that healthier choices, such as carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and most dark gr een, leafy vegetables are good sour ces of beta-car otene, vitamin A ’s precursor form. Instruct the patient to choose intense-color ed fruit or vegetables, which have high beta- carotene content. Pr ovide r eferrals to appr opriate community agencies if necessary . VITAMIN B DEFICIENCIES Vitamin B complex is a group of water -soluble vitamins essential to normal metabolism, cell growth, and blood formation. (See Recommended daily allowance of B complex vitamins .) The most common deficiencies involve thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), and cobalamin (B12). Recommended daily allowance of B complex vitamins VitaminMen (age 23 to 70)Women (age 23 to 70) InfantsChildren (age 1 to 18) B1* 1.2 mg 1.1 mg 0.2 to 0.3 mg0.5 to 1.2 mg B2* 1.3 mg 1.1 mg 0.3 to 0.4 mg0.5 to 1.3 mg Niacin *16 mg 14 mg 2 to 4 mg 6 to 16 mg VitaminMen (age 23 to 70)Women (age 23 to 70) InfantsChildren (age 1 to 18) B6 1.3 mg 1.3 mg 0.1 to 0.3 mg0.5 to 1.3 mg B12 2.4 μg 2.4 μg 0.4 to 0.5 μg 0.9 to 2.4 μg *Requirements per 1,000 kcal of dietary intake. Causes and Incidence Thiamine defic iency results from malabsorption or inadequ ate dietary intake of vitamin  B1. It also results from alcoholism, prolonged diarrhea, or from increased requirement, which can occur in pregnancy , lactation, and hyperthyroidism. Beriberi, a serious thiamine deficiency disease, is most prevalent in Asians, who subsist mainly on diets of unenrich ed rice and wheat. Although  this disease is uncommon in the United States , alcoholics may develop cardiac (wet) beriberi with high-output heart failure, neuropathy , and cerebral disturbances. In times of stress (e.g., pregnancy), malnourished young adults may develop beriberi; infantile beriberi may appear in infants on low-protei n diets or in those breast-fed by thiamine- deficient mothers. Riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) results from a diet deficient in milk, meat, fish, legumes, and green, leafy vegetables. Alcoholism or prolonged diarrhea may also induce riboflavin deficiency . Exposure of milk to sunlight or treatment of legumes with baking soda can destroy riboflavin. Niacin deficiency , in its advanced form, produces pellagra, which affects the skin, central nervous system (CNS), and GI tract. (See Recognizing pellagra , page 493.) Although this deficiency is now seldom found in the United States, it was once common among Southerners who subsisted mainly on corn and consumed  minimal animal protein. (Corn is low in niacin and in available tryptophan, the amino acid from whic h the body synthesizes niacin.) Niacin deficiency is still common in parts of Egypt, Romania, Africa, Serbia, and Montenegro, where corn is the dominant staple food. Niacin deficiency  can also occur secondary to carcinoid syndrome or Hartnup disease. Recognizing pellagra This patient with pellagra shows dark, scaly , advanced dermatitis. In advanced niacin deficiency , such dermatitis usually occurs on areas exposed to the sun. Pyridoxine deficiency usually results from destruction of pyridoxine in infant formulas by autoclaving. A frank deficiency is uncommon in adults, except in patients taking pyridoxine antagonists, such as isoniazid and penicillamine. Cobalamin deficiency most commonly results from an absence of intrinsic factor in gastric secret ions, or an absence of recepto r sites after ileal resection. Other causes include malabsorption syndromes associated with sprue, intestinal worm infestation, regional ileitis, and gluten enteropathy , and a diet low in animal protein. PathophysiologyThiamine deficiency (B1)—when healthy individuals are deprived of thiamine, thiamine stores are depleted within 1 month. However , within a week after thiamine intake stops, healthy people develop a resting tachycardia, weakness, and decreased deep tendon reflexes; some people develop a peripheral neuropathy . Riboflavin deficiency (B2)—riboflavin deficiency can alter iron absorption and cause an anemia that leads to fatigue. Riboflavin  is involved in red blood cell (RBC) production and transportation of oxygen to the cells. Improvin g the amount of riboflavin in the body can increase circulating hemo globin levels and increase red cell production. Collagen is a protein found in most skin and hair, so riboflavin is necessary  to maintain a good collagen level. Taking supplements of riboflavin is also a cure for migraines. Research showed that 400 mg of riboflavin a day had demonstrated efficacy in prevention of a migraine in adults, but it must be taken for a minimum of 3 months for good results. This is most likely because mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to play a role in migraines, and riboflavin is a precursor of flavin cofactors of the electron transport chain. Niacin deficiency (B3)—niacin is essential for adequa te cellular function because of its required roles in two similar but distinct coenzymes (i.e., nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD] and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADP]). Both of these are cofactors that can be recycled by serving as both oxidizing (NAD, NADP) and reducing (NADH, NADPH) agents. During the oxidation of glucos e and other intermediary metabolites, a substantial amount of chemical energy is released. NAD/NADH are able to transfer electrons in a process that captures the energy by gene rating high- energy phosphate bonds. The synthesized ATP then provides the energy necessary for other reactions of intermediary metabolism that simultaneously regenerate NAD from the reduced NADH. A portion of this cofactor is also converted to NADP/NADPH, which plays several distinct roles. Reduced NADPH is used in reactions that detoxify reactive oxygen species, that metabolize drugs  in a cytochrome P450 system , and that support lipid biosynthesis. Pyridoxine deficiency (B6)—after absorpt ion, pyridoxine,  pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal are transported into hepatic cells by facilitate d diffusion. Pyridoxal kinase  phosphorylates pyridoxine and pyridoxamine,  after whichthey are convert ed to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) by a flavin -dependent enzyme. PLP either remains in the hepatocyte, where it is bound to an apoenzyme, or it is released into the serum, where it is tightly bound to albumin. Free pyridoxal is degraded by alkaline phosphatase, hepatic and renal aldehyde oxidases, and pyridoxal dehydrogenase. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate is an essential cofactor in various transamination, decarboxylation, and synthesis pathways involving carbohydrates, sphingolipids, sulfur -containing amino acids, heme, and neurotransmitters. PLP is a coenzyme of tryptophan, methionine, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism. With methionine deficiency , S-adenosylmethionine accumulate s, resulting in the inhibition of sphingolipid and myelin synth esis. Tryptophan is a precursor to several neurotransmitters and is required for niacin production. Thus, pyridoxine deficiency can cause a syndrome indistinguishable from pellagra. PLP is a cofactor for glutamic acid decar boxylase, the enzyme that produces GABA, such that PLP deficiency results in insuf ficient GABA. Since GABA is the major inhibitor cortical neurotransmitter , PLP deficiency can lead to seizures. Interestingly , pyridoxine-dependent seizures are not caused by a pyridoxine defic iency per se but rather due to an increased depletion of PLP. The neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, glycine, glutam ate, and GABA also require PLP for their production. Homocysteine metabolism is dependent on pyridoxine, with the development of a macrocytic anemia and neurologic complications. Complications heart failure neuropathy pellagra anemiaseizures Signs and Symptoms Thiamine deficiency causes polyneuritis and, possibly , Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakof f psychosis. In infants (infantile beriberi), this deficiency produces edema, irritability"
"Eye Disorders Introduction Vision, The Most Complex Sense, Has Been The Focus Of Significant Medical And Sur gical Innovations. Disorders That Af fect The Eye Can Lead T o Vision Loss Or Impairment; Routine Ophthalmic Examinations And Early T reatment Can Help Prevent It. REVIEW OF ANA TOMY The visual system consists main ly of the eyeball, optic nerves,  extraocular muscles, cranial nerves, blood vessels, orbital fat, and lacrimal system, which are all housed within the bony orbit, and the eyelid, whic h covers the eye, moistens it, and protects it from injury . The orbit (also called the socket ) encloses the eye in a protective recess in the skull. Its seven bones— frontal, sphenoid, zygomatic, maxillary , palatine, ethmoid, and lacrimal—form a cone. The apex of this cone points toward the brain, and the cone’ s base forms the orbital rim. Extraocular muscles hold the eyes in place and control their movement, as described below: superior r ectus:  elevates the eye upward; adducts and rotates the eye inwardinferior r ectus:  depresses the eye downward; adducts and rotates the eye outward lateral r ectus:  abducts or turns the eye outward (laterally) medial r ectus:  adducts or turns the eye inward (medially) superior oblique:  rotates the eye inward; abducts and depresses the eye inferior oblique:  rotates the eye outward; abducts and elevates the eye The actions of these muscles are mutually antagonistic: As one contracts, its opposing muscle relaxes. ELDER TIP  Eye structur e and activity change with age. The eyes set deeper in their sockets and the eyelids lose their elasticity , allowing the orbital fat to pr otrude forwar d. Eyelids appear mor e saggy and wrinkled . OCULAR LA YERS The Eye Has Three Structural Layers: The Sclera And Cornea, The Uveal Tract, And The Retina. (See Cross Section Of The Eye , Page 595.) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY   CROSS SECTION OF THE EYE The sclera is the dense, white, fibrous outer protective coat of the eye. It meets the cornea at the limbus (corneoscleral junction) anterio rly and the dural sheath of the optic nerve posteriorly . The lamina cribrosa is a sievelike structu re composed of a few strands of scleral tissue through which the optic nerve bundles pass. The sclera is covered by the episclera, a thin layer of fine elastic tissue. ELDER TIP  In older adults, lens changes occur typically with the formation of a cataract. The vitr eous body liquefies and pulls away from the r etina, generating floating vitr eous debris and vitr eous detachments . The cornea is the transparent, avascular , dome-shaped layer of the eye that’s continuous with the sclera. The cornea consists of five layers: the epithelium, which contains sensory nerves; Bowman’ s mem brane, the basement memb rane for the epithelial cells; the stroma, or suppo rting tissue (90% of the corneal structure); Descemet’ s membrane, containing many elastic fibers; and the endothel ium, a single layer of cells that acts as apump to maintain proper dehydration or detumescence of the cornea. Aqueous humor  bathes the poste rior surface of the cornea, providing it with nutrients, and maintaining intrao cular pressure (IOP) by volume and rate of outflow . The anterior cornea is kept moist by the tear film. ELDER TIP  Dry Eye Syndr ome Is Mor e Common In The Elderly . Certain Medications, Such As Histamines, Some Antidepr essants, And Antihypertensives, As W ell As Systemic Conditions (Such As Menopause, Diabetes, And Thyr oid Disor ders), Can Exacerbate Dry Eyes, Which May Result In Decr eased V ision, Eye Redness, And Discomfort . The Middle Layer Of The Eye, The Uveal T ract, Is Pigmented And Vascular . It Consists Of The Iris And The Ciliary Body In The Anterior Portion And The Choroid In The Posterior Portion. In The Center Of The Iris Is The Pupil. The Sphincter And Dilator Muscles Control The Amount Of Light That Enters The Eye By Changing The Size Of The Pupil. ELDER TIP  It is believed that atr ophy of the dilator muscle fibers and increased rigidity of the blood vessels of the iris r educe pupil size, decreasing the amount of light that r eaches the r etina. Consequently , higher levels of illumination may be needed to impr ove uncorr ected visual acuity in the older adult . The angle formed by the anterior iris surface and the posterior corneal structures contains the many minute collecting channels of the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor drains through these channels into an encircling venous system called the canal of Schlemm . The ciliary body , which extends  from the root of the iris to the peripheral retina, produces aqueous humor and controls lens accommodation through its action on the zonular fibers. The choroid, the largest part of the uveal tract, is made up of blood vessels bound externally by the suprachoroid and internally by the retina. The retina is the innermost coat of the eye. It receives visual images in the form  of light and conver ts the images into neural impulses. The photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) are the light-sensitive cells. These and other retina cell types are interconnected by synapses and organized in layers that trans mit the neural signals to the brain. Although both rods and cones are light receptors, they respond to light differently . Rods, scatteredthroughout the retina, respond to low levels of light and detect moving objects; cones, located in the fovea centralis, function best in brighter light and perceive finer details. Three types of cones contain different visual pigments and react to specific light wavelengths: one type reacts to red light, one to green, and one to blue-violet. The eye mixes these colors into various shades. ELDER TIP  Many elderly patients lose their ability to discriminate blue-gr eens, and white objects appear yellowish; these patients may also have difficulty discriminating among pastels, violets, and yellow- greens. The r etinal pigmented epithelium layer , which is just posterior to the photor eceptors, has multiple support functions, including phagocytosis of photor eceptor segments, vitamin A metabolism, and r egulation of molecule transport to the r etina . THE LENS AND ACCOMMODA TION The lens of the eye is biconvex, avascular , and transparent; the lens capsule is a semipermeable membrane that encloses the lens and allow s water and nutrients to reach the lens cells. The lens changes shape (acco mmodation) for near and far vision. For near vision, the ciliary body contracts and relaxes the zonules, the lens becomes steeper , the pupil constricts, and the eyes conver ge; for far vision, the ciliary body relaxes, the zonules tighten, the lens becomes flatter , the eyes straighten, and the pupils dilate. The lens refines the refraction necessary to focus a clear image on the retina. ELDER TIP  In older adults, lens changes occur , typically with the formation of a cataract. Symptoms of a cataract include glar e, decr eased vision, and the need for incr eased illumination. The purpose of cataract surgery is to r emove the opacified lens (cataract) and to sharpen vision . The vitreous body, which is 99% water and a small amount of insoluble protein, constitu tes two thirds of the eye’s volume. This transparent, gelatinous body  gives the eye its shape and contributes to the refraction of light rays. The vitreous is firmly attached to the peripheral retina near the ciliary body (anteriorly) and to the optic disk (posteriorly). The vitreous face contacts the lens; the vitreous gel rests against the retina. LACRIMAL APP ARA TUS AND EYELIDSThe lacrimal apparatus consists of the lacrimal glands, upper and lower canaliculi, lacrim al sac, and nasolacrimal duct. The main gland, located in a shallow fossa beneath the superior temporal orbital rim, secretes reflex tears. Small lacrimal glands throughout the conjunctiva are responsible for basal tear production. Multiple sebaceous glands in the eyelids produce an oily secretion that prevents tears from evaporating. With every blink, the eyelids direct the flow to the inner canthus, where the tears pool and then drain through a tiny opening called the punctum . The tears then pass through the canaliculi and lacrimal sac and down the nasolacrimal duct, which opens into the nasal cavity. The integrity of the lacrima l system is critical for moisturizing and also removing excess tears from the corneal surface. The eyelids (palpebrae) consis t of tarsal plates that are composed of dense connective tissue. The orbital septum—the fascia behind the orbicularis oculi muscle—acts as a barrier between the lids and the orbit. The levator palpebrae muscle elevates the upper lid. The eyelids contain three types of glands: glands of Zeis—modified sebaceous glands connected to the follicles of the eyelashes meibomian glands—sebaceous glands in the tarsal plates that secrete an oily substance as a tear film component (About 25 of these glands are found in the upper lid and about 20 in the lower lid.) Moll glands—ordinary sweat glands The conjunctiva  is the thin mucous membrane that lines the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva), folds over at the fornix, and covers the surface of the eyeball (bulbar conjunctiva). The conjunctiva produces mucin, another component of the tear film. The ophthalmic, lacrimal, and multiple anastomoses of facial arteries supply blood to the lids. The space between the open lids is the palpebral fissure; the juncture of the uppe r and lower lids is the canthu s. The junction near the nose is called the nasal, medial, or inner canthus; the junction on the temporal side, the lateral or external canthus. OPTIC NER VE The optic nerve is composed of the nerve fibers (axons) that originate in the retina and synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus in the brain.Approximately 1 million nerve axons are contained in the optic nerve. The nerve from each eye exits the eye posteriorly and courses throu gh the orbit to the optic canal. Both nerves meet at the optic chiasm, located intracranially near the pituitary gland. In the optic chiasm, part of the nerve fibers from one eye cross to the other side, and vice versa. From the synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus, nerves carry visual information to the visual cortex, located in the majority of the occipital lobe of the brain. Some axons from the optic nerve synapse at other parts of the brain to regulate pupil responses, eye movements, and the sleep–wake cycle. ELDER TIP  Age-r elated vision changes ar e usually first noticed during the fifth decade of life and may include the inability to focus, narrowing of the visual field, r educed peripheral vision, and loss of iris elasticity pr oducing decr eased r esponse to light and dark. In addition, as people age, pr oduction of any of the thr ee tear film components may decrease, causing dry eyes . DEPTH PERCEPTION In normal binocular vision, a perceived image is projected onto the two foveae. Impulse s then travel along the optic pathways to the occipital cortex, which perceives a single image. However , the cortex receives two images—each from a slightly different angle—giving the images perspective and providing depth perception. VISION TESTING Several tests assess visual acuity and identify visual defects: Ishihara test determines color blindness by using a series of plates composed of a colored background, with a letter , number , or pattern of a contrasting color located in the center of each plate. The patient with deficient color perception can’ t perceive the dif ferences in color or , consequently , the designs formed by the color contrasts. The Snellen chart or other eye charts evaluate visual acuity . Such charts use progressively smaller letters or symbols to determine central vision on a numerical scale. A person with normal acuity should be able to read the letters or recognize the symbols on the 20/20 line of the eye chart at a distance of 20′.SUBJECTIVE TESTING Several tests accomplish objective testing of the eyes. B-mode ultrasonography delineates retinal tumors, detachments, and vitreous hemorrhages—even in the presence of opacities of the cornea and lens. A handheld B-scanner has simplified ultrasonic examination of the eye, making it possible to perform such studies in the eye care practitioner ’s office. The cover -uncover test assesses eye muscle misalignment or tendency toward misalignment. In this test, the patient stares at a small, fixed object—first from a distance of 20′ (6.1 m) and then from 1′ (0.3 m). The examiner covers the patient’ s eyes one at a time, noting any movement of the uncovered eye and the direction of any deviation. In exotropia the eyes are naturally deviated outward. In the cover -uncover test, the eyes recover by moving inward to focus. The reverse is true in esotropia. Duction test checks eye movement in all directions of gaze. While one eye is covered, the other eye follows a moving light. This test detects weakness of rotation due to muscle paralysis or structural dysfunction. Fluorescein angiography evaluates the blood vessels in the choroid and retina after I.V . injection of fluorescein dye; images of the dye-enhanced vasculature are recorded by rapid-sequence photographs of the fundus. Goldmann applanation, T onopen tonometry , and pneumotonometry all measure IOP . After instilling a local anesthetic in the patient’ s eye, the examiner touches the T onopen tonometer tip to the surface of the cornea. The IOP reading is displayed and measured in mm Hg. Applanation tonometry gauges the force required to flatten a small area of the central cornea, and is the most accurate method of measuring IOP . For this test, a patient must be seated at a slit lamp and the cornea stained with fluorescein dye before the prism of the applanation tonometer touches the cornea and the examiner adjusts the controls until the two lines form an “S.” Gonioscopy allows for direct visualization of the anterior chamber angle. The Maddox rod test assesses muscle dysfunction; it’ s especially useful in disclosing and measuring heterophoria (the tendency of the eyes to deviate). It can reveal horizontal, vertical, and, especially , torsional deviations.Ophthalmoscopy—direct ophthalmoscopy or binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy allows examination of the interior of the eye after the pupil has been dilated with a mydriatic. A light source and lenses are used by the examiner to focus on the posterior ocular structures (such as the retina and optic nerve). Refraction tests may be performed with or without cycloplegics. In cycloplegic refraction, eyedrops weaken the accommodative power of the ciliary muscle. Lenses placed in front of the eye direct light rays onto the retina, thus focusing the image so that it can be transmitted along the visual pathway . A retinoscope may be used in the same way by directing a beam of light through the pupil onto the retina; the light’ s shadow is neutralized by placing the appropriate lens in front of the eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination allows a well-illuminated examination of the eyelids and the anterior segment of the eyeball using a specialized microscope. Visual field tests assess the function of the retina, the optic nerve, and the optic pathways by recording the responses of the patient to light impulses directed to various areas of the visual field. Eyelid and Lacrimal Ducts BLEPHARITIS A common inflammation, blepharitis produces a red-rimmed appearance of the margins of the eyelids. It’s frequently chronic and bilate ral and can affect both upper and lower lids. Seborrheic blepharitis is characterized by formation of waxy scales on the eyelashes and eyelid margins, and symptoms of burning and foreign body sensation. Pathophysiology Seborrheic blepharitis may be seen in conjunction with seborrhea of the scalp, eyebrows, and ears. It’s common in elderly people and in people with red hair. Staphylococcal (ulcerative) blepharitis is characterized by the formation of dry scales along the inflamed lid margins, whic h also have ulcerated areas and may be associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a dry eye synd rome. Staphylococcal blepharitis is associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection and is more common in females than in males. Both typesmay coexist. Blepharitis tends to recur and become chronic . It can be controlled if treatment begins before the onset of ocular involvement. Aller gies and eyelash infestatio ns with lice are less common causes of blepharitis. Blep haritis may also be associated with repeated styes and chalazion. Complications Keratitis Conjunctivitis Dry eyes Signs and Symptoms Clinical features of blepharitis include itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and sticky , crusted eyelids on waking. This constant irritation results in unconscious rubbing of the eyes (causing reddened rims) or continual blinking. Other signs include waxy scales in seborrheic blepharitis; and flaky scales on lashes, loss of lashes, and ulcerated areas on lid mar gins in ulcerative blepharitis. Diagnosis Diagnosis depends on patient history and characteristic symptoms. In staphylococcal blepharitis, culture of ulcerated lid mar gin shows S. aur eus. Treatment The goals of therapy are to control the disease and its underlying causes, maintain vision, and avoid secondary complications. Treatment depends on the type of blepharitis: blepharitis resulting from pediculosis—removal of nits (with forceps) or application of ophthalmic physostigmine or other ointment as an insecticide (This may cause pupil constriction and, possibly , headache, conjunctival irritation, and blurred vision from the film of ointment on the cornea.) seborrheic blepharitis—daily lid hygiene (using a mild shampoo on a damp applicator stick or a washcloth) and hot compresses to remove scales from the lid mar gins; also, frequent shampooing of the scalp and eyebrowsstaphylococcal blepharitis—warm compresses and an antibiotic, such as tetracycline or erythromycin eye ointment, may be used. For some patients, systemic antibiotics are indicated Special Considerations Instruct the patient to gently remove scales from the lid mar gins daily , with an applicator stick or a clean washcloth. Teach the patient the following method for applying warm compresses: First, run warm water into a clean bowl. Then, immerse a clean cloth in the water and wring it out. Place the warm cloth against the closed eyelid (be careful not to burn the skin). Hold the compress in place until it cools. Continue this procedure for 15 minutes. Antibiotic ophthalmic ointment should be applied after 15-minute application of warm compresses. Treatment for seborrheic blepharitis also requires attention to the face and scalp. EXOPHTHALMOS Exophthalmos (also called proptosis ) is the unilatera l or bilateral bulging or protrusion of the eyeballs or their apparent forward displacement (with lid retraction). The prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Pathophysiology and Incidence Exophthalmos commonly results from hyperthyroidism, particularly ophthalmic Grav es disease, in which the eyeballs are displaced forward and the lids retract. Unilateral exophthalmos may also result from trauma (such as fracture of the ethmoid bone, which allows air from the sinus to enter the orbital tissue, displacing soft tissue and the eyeball forward). Exophthalmos may also stem from hemorrhage, varicosities, thrombosis, and edema, all of which similarly displace one or both eyeballs forward. Other systemic and ocular causes include: infection—orbital cellulitis, panophthalmitis, and infection of the lacrimal gland or orbital tissues parasitic cysts—in surrounding tissue tumors and neoplastic diseases—in children, rhabdomyosarcomas, leukemia, gliomas of the optic nerve, dermoid cysts, teratomas,metastatic neuroblastomas, and lymphoma; in adults, lacrimal gland tumors, mucoceles, cavernous hemangioma, meningiomas, metastatic carcinomas, and lymphoma Signs and Symptoms The obvious sign is a bulging eyeball, commonly with diplo pia, due to eyeball misalignment or extraoc ular muscle dysfunction. (See Recognizing exophthalmos .) A rim of the sclera may be visible below the upper lid as lid retraction occu rs. Other symptoms depend on the cause: pain may accompany traumatic exophtha lmos; a tumor may produce conjunctival hyperemia or chemosis; retracti on of the upper lid predisposes to exposure keratitis. If exophthalmos is associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis, the patient may exhibit paresis of the muscles supplied by cranial nerves III, IV, and VI; limited ocular movement; and a septic-type (high) fever . Recognizing Exophthalmos This photograph shows the characteristic forward protrusion of the eyes from the orbit associated with exophthalmos. Diagnosis Exophthalmos is usually obvious on physical examination; exophthalmometer readings confirm diagnosis by showing the degree of anterior projecti on and asymmetry between the eyes (normal bar readings range from 12 to 20 mm). The following diagnostic measures identify the cause: Computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging detects swollen extraocular muscles or lesions within the orbit. Culture of dischar ge determines the infecting or ganism; sensitivity testing indicates appropriate antibiotic therapy . Biopsy of orbital tissue may be necessary if initial treatment fails. Treatment Eye trauma may require cold compresses for the first 24 hours, followed by warm compresses, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy . After edema subsides, surgery may be necessary in a small percentage of cases. It is important to counsel patients with acute orbital fractures not to blow their nose, to avoid air entering the orbit, which may cause acute exophthalmos. Eye infection requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics during the 24 hours preceding positive identification of the organism, followed by specific antibiotics. A patient with exophthalmos resulting from an orbital tumor may initially benefit from antibiotic or corticosteroid therapy . Eventually , surgical exploration of the orbit and excision of the tumor , enucleation, or exenteration may be necessary . Radiation and chemotherapy may be used when primary orbital tumors can’t be fully excised as encapsulated lesions, such as in rhabdomyosarcoma lesions. Treatment for Graves disease may include antithyroid drug therapy or partial or total thyroidectomy to control hyperthyroidism; initial high doses of systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, for optic neuropathy and, if lid retraction is severe, protective lubricants. Surgery may include orbital decompression (removal of any of the orbital walls) if vision is threatened, followed by muscle surgery and then lid surgery (eyelid retraction repair). Special Considerations It is critical to protect the exposed cornea with lubricants to prevent corneal drying until the disease stabilizes or is corrected by sur gery. PTOSISPtosis (droopin g of the upper eyelid) may be congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral, and constant or intermittent. Severe ptosis usually responds well to treatment; slight ptosis may require no treatment at all. Pathophysiology Congenital ptosis is transmitted  as an autosomal dominant trait or results from a congenit al anomaly in which the levator muscles of the eyelids fail to develop. This condition is usually unilateral. Acquired ptosis may result from any of the following: advanced age (involutional ptosis, the most common form, usually seen in older patients) mechanical factors that make the eyelid heavy , such as swelling caused by a foreign body on the palpebral surface of the eyelid or by edema, inflammation produced by a tumor or pseudotumor , or an extra fatty fold myogenic factors, such as muscular dystrophy or myasthenia gravis (in which the defect appears to be in humoral transmission at the myoneural junction) neurogenic (paralytic) factors from interference in innervation of the eyelid by the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), most commonly due to trauma, diabetes, or carotid aneurysm (Ptosis due to oculomotor nerve damage produces a fixed, dilated pupil, diver gent strabismus, and slight depression of the eyeball.) nutritional factors, such as thiamine deficiency in chronic alcoholism, hyperemesis gravidarum, and other malnutrition-producing states Risk factors for ptosis include aging, diabetes, stroke, Horner syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and cancer that af fects nerve or muscle response. In myasthenia gravis, ptosis results from fatigue and characteristically appears in the evening but is relieved by rest. The child with unilateral ptosis that covers the pupil can develop an amblyopic eye from disuse or lack of eye stimulation. In bilateral ptosis, the child may elevate the brow in an attempt to compensate, wrinkling the forehead in an effort to raise the upper lid. Additionally , the child may tip the head backward to see. ComplicationLazy eye in children (amblyopia) Signs and Symptoms PEDIA TRIC TIP  An infant with congenital ptosis has a smooth, flat upper eyelid, without the eyelid fold normally caused by the pull of the levator muscle; associated weakness of the superior r ectus muscle isn’ t uncommon . Diagnosis Examination includes measurement of the position of the upper eyelid margin relative to the pupil, degree of eyelid excursion, presence  or absence of lagophthalmos, Bell phenome non, and eyelid crease. Diagnosis may also include these tests to determine any underlying cause: digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance imaging— aneurysm glucose tolerance test—diabetes ophthalmologic examination—foreign bodies patient history—chronic alcoholism Tensilon test—myasthenia gravis (in acquired ptosis with no history of trauma) Treatment Slight ptosis that doesn’ t produ ce deformity or loss of vision requires no treatment. Severe ptosis that interferes with vision or is cosmetically undesirable usually necessitates reattachment of a stretch ed levator aponeurosis. Surgery to correct  congenital ptosis is usually performed at age 3 or 4, but it may be done earlier if amblyopia is a concern. The sur gical approach depen ds on the degree of ptosis. If surgery is contraindicated, special glasses with an attached suspended crutch on the frames may elevate the eyelid. Effective treatm ent for ptosis also requires treatment for any underlying cause. For example, in patient s with myasthenia gravis, neostigmine or steroids may be prescribed to increase the effect of acetylcholine and aid transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. Special ConsiderationsAfter sur gery to correct ptosis, watch for blood on the pressure patch. (Some sur gical procedures may not require a patch.) Apply ointment to the sutures as prescribed. Emphasize to the patient and family the need to prevent accidental trauma to the sur gical site until healing is complete (6 weeks). Suture line damage can precipitate recurrence of ptosis. ORBIT AL CELLULITIS Orbital cellulitis is an acute infection of the orbital tissues and eyelids that doesn’ t involve  the eyeball. With treatment, the prognosis is good; if untreated, the infection may spread intracranially to the cavernous sinus or the meninges, where it can be life-threatening. Pathophysiology Orbital cellulitis  may result from bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection. It can develop from direct inocul ation, via the bloodstream, or spread from adjacent structures (e.g., the sinuses or eyelids). Periorbital tissues may be inoculated as a result of surgery, foreign body trauma, and even animal or insect bites. PEDIA TRIC TIP  The most common pathogens in childr en ar e Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. aureus. In young childr en, infection spr eads fr om adjacent sinuses (especially the ethmoid air cells) and accounts for the majority of postseptal cellulitis cases. The incidence has decr eased because of the use of the H. influenzae b (Hib) vaccine . Immunosuppressed patients are also susceptible. Complications Cavernous sinus thrombosis Hearing loss Septicemia Meningitis Optic nerve damageSigns and Symptoms Orbital cellulitis generally produces unilateral eyelid edema, reddened eyelids, and matted lashes. Although the eyeball is initially unaffected, proptosis develops later (because of edematous tissues withi n the bony confines of the orbit). Other indications include extreme orbital pain, impaired eye movement, chemosis, purulent dischar ge from indurated areas, decreased vision, and an afferent pupillary defect. The severity of associated systemic symptoms (chills, fever , and malaise) varies according to the cause. Complications include posterior extension, causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, panophthalmitis, meningitis, or brain abscess and, rarely , atrophy and subsequent loss of vision secondary to optic neuritis. Diagnosis Typical clinical features establish diagnosis. Computed tomography scan or magnetic resona nce imaging of the sinuses and orbit tissues will determine if the cause of the cellulitis is preseptal or if deeper structures are involved, or if a tumor is the cause of swelling. Usually the patient will also be febrile with this type of infection. Wound culture and sensitivity testing determine the causative organism and specific antibiotic therapy . Other tests include white blood cell count and ophthalmologic examination. Treatment Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent complications. Primary treatment consists of antibiotic therapy . Systemic antibiotics (I.V. or oral) and eyedrops or ointment will be ordered. Supportive therapy consists of fluids; warm, moist compresses; and bed rest. The patient should be monitored closely . If during the initial 48 to 72 hours of treatment no improvement is seen, adjustment of antibiotics guided by drug sensitivity should be considered. If an orbital absces s is present, surgical incision and drainage may be necessary . Special Considerations Monitor vital signs at least every 4 hours, and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.Have the patient instill antibiotic eyedrops frequently during the day and apply ointment at night. Apply compresses every 3 to 4 hours to localize inflammation and relieve discomfort. T each the patient to apply these compresses. Give pain medication, as ordered, after assessing pain level. Before dischar ge, stress the importance of completing prescribed antibiotic therapy . To prevent orbital cellulitis, tell the patient to maintain good general hygiene and to carefully clean abrasions and cuts that occur near the orbit. Ensure patient has appropriate follow-up. PREVENTION Use Hib vaccination to pr event Haemophilus infection in childr en. Treat sinus and dental infections early to decr ease spr ead to the eye . DACR YOCYSTITIS Dacryocystitis is an infection of the lacrimal sac. It can be acute , chronic, or congenital. In infants, dacryocy stitis results from congenital atresia of the nasolacrimal duct; in adults, it results from an obstruction (dacryostenosis) of the nasolacrimal duct (most common in women older than age 40). Pathophysiology Atresia of the nasolacrimal ducts results from failure of canaliz ation or, in the first few months of life, from blockage when the mem brane that separates the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct and the inferior nasal meatus fails to open spontaneously before tear secretion. Bony obstruction of the duct may also occur . In acute dacryocystitis, S. aureus and, occasionally , beta-hemolytic streptococci are the cause. In chronic dacryocystitis, S. pneumoniae  or, sometimes, a fungus—such as Actinomyces  or Candida albicans —is the causative organism. Primary lumps and secondary tumors from sinuses, nose, and orbits have also been reported as causes. Complication Orbital cellulitisSigns and Symptoms The hallmark of both the acute and chronic forms of dacry ocystitis is constant tearing . Other symptoms of dacryocystitis include inflammation and tenderness over the nasolacrimal sac; pressure over this area may fail to produce purulent dischar ge from the punctum. Acute dacryocystitis is painful for the patient. Diagnosis Clinical features and a physical examination suggest dacryocystitis. Culture of the dischar ged material demonstrates S. aureus and, occasiona lly, beta- hemolytic strep tococci in acute dacryocystitis, and S. pneumoniae  or C. albicans  in the chronic form. The white blood cell count may be elevated  in the acute form; in the chronic form, it’s generally normal. An X-ray after injection of a radiopaque medium (dacryocystography) locates the atresia in infants. Treatment Treatment for acute dacryocystitis consists of warm compresses, and,7"
"Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorders Introduction Ear, nose, and throat disorders rarely prove fatal (except for those resulting from neoplasms, epiglottitis, and neck trauma), but they may cause serious social, cosmetic, and communication problems. Untreated hearing loss or deafness can drastically impai r the ability to interact with society . Ear disorders also can cause impaired equilibrium. Nasal disorders can cause changes in facial features and interfere with breathing and tasting. Diseases arising in the throat may threaten airway patency and interfere with speech. In additi on, these disorders can cause considerable discomfort and pain for the patient and require thorough assessment and prompt treatment. THE EAR Hearing begins when sound waves reach the tympanic membrane, which then vibrates the ossicles, incus, malleus, and stapes in the middle ear cavity . The stapes transmits these vibrations to the perilymphatic fluid in the inner ear by vibrating agains t the oval window . The vibratio ns then pass across the cochlea’ s fluid receptor cells in the basilar membrane, stimulating movement of the hair cells of the organ of Corti. The axons of the coch lear nerve terminate around the bases of those hair cells. Sound waves, which initiate impulses, travel over the auditory nerve (made up ofthe coch lear nerve and the vestibular nerve) to the temporal lobe of the brain. The inner ear structures also maintain the body’ s equilibrium and balance through the fluid in the semicircular canals. This fluid is set in motion by body movement and stimulates nerve cells that line the canals. These cells, in turn, transmit impulses to the cerebellum of the brain by way of the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve (the acoustic nerve). Although the ear can respond to sounds that vibrate at frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz, the range of normal speech is from 250 to 4,000 Hz, with 70% falling between 500 and 2,000 Hz. The ratio between sound intensities, the decibel (dB) is the unit for expressing the relative intensity (loudness) of sounds. A faint whisper registers 10 to 15 dB; average conversation, 50 to 60 dB; a shout, 85 to 90 dB. Hearing damage may follow exposure to sounds louder than 90 dB. ASSESSMENT After obtaining a thorough patient history of any ear disease, inspect the auricle and surrounding tissue for deformities, lumps, and skin lesions. (See Structur es of the external ear, page 626.) Ask the patient if they have ear pain. If you see inflammation, check for tenderness by moving  the auricle and pressing on the tragus and the mastoid process. Check the ear canal for excessive cerumen, dischar ge, or foreign bodies. Structur es of the External Ear The structures of the external ear are depicted below . Ask the patient if they have had episodes of vertigo or blurred vision. To test for vertigo, have the patient stand on one foot and close their eyes, orhave them walk a straight line with their eyes closed. Ask them if they always fall to the same side and if the room seems to be spinning. AUDIOMETRIC TESTING Audiometric testing evaluates hearing and determines the type and extent of hearing loss. The simplest but least reliable method for judging hearing acuity consists of covering one of the patient’ s ears, standing 18″ to 24″ (46 to 61 cm) from the uncovered ear, and whispering a short phrase or series of numbers. (Block  the patient’ s vision to prevent lip reading.) Then ask the patient to repeat the phrase or series of numbers. To test hearing at both high and low frequencies, repeat the test in a normal speaking voice. (As an alternative, you can hold a ticking watch to the patient’ s ear.) If you identify a hearing loss, further testing is necessary to determine if the loss is conductive or sensorineural. A conductive loss can result from faulty bone conduction (inability of the eighth cranial nerve to respond to sound waves traveling through the skull) or faulty air conduction (impaired transmission of sound through ear structures to the auditory nerve and, ultimately , the temporal lobe of the brain). Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the cochlear or vestibulocochlear nerve, which can result from aging and prolonged exposure to high frequency or loud noises. The following tests assess bone and air conduction: Impedance audiometry detects middle ear pathology , precisely determining the degree of tympanic membrane and middle ear mobility . One end of the impedance audiometer , a probe with three small tubes, is inserted into the external canal; the other end is attached to an oscillator . One tube delivers a low tone of variable intensity , the second contains a microphone, and the third, an air pump. A mobile tympanic membrane reflects minimal sound waves and produces a low-voltage curve on the graph. A tympanic membrane with decreased mobility reflects maximal sound waves and produces a high-voltage curve. Pure tone audiometry uses an audiometer to produce a series of pure tones of calibrated decibels of loudness at dif ferent frequencies (125 to 8,000 Hz). These test tones are conveyed to the patient’ s ears through headphones or a bone conduction (sound) vibrator . Speech threshold represents the loudness at which a person with normal hearing canperceive the tone. Both air conduction and bone conduction are measured for each ear , and the results are plotted on a graph. If hearing is normal, the line is plotted at 0 dB. In adults, normal hearing may range from 0 to 25 dB. In the Rinne test, the base of a lightly vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process (bone conduction). Then the fork is moved to the front of the meatus, where the patient should continue to hear the vibrations (air conduction). The patient must determine which sounds are heard longer . In a positive Rinne test, sounds heard through air conduction are heard relatively longer than those heard through bone conduction. This may suggest sensorineural hearing loss. In a negative Rinne test, sounds heard through bone conduction are heard longer than those heard through air conduction, which may suggest a conductive loss. Speech audiometry uses the same technique as pure tone audiometry , but with speech, instead of pure tones, transmitted through the headset. (A person with normal hearing can hear and repeat 88% to 100% of transmitted words.) Tympanometry , using the impedance audiometer , measures tympanic membrane compliance with air pressure variations in the external canal and determines the degree of negative pressure in the middle ear . In W eber test (used for testing unilateral hearing loss), the handle of a lightly vibrating tuning fork is placed on the midline of the forehead. Normally , the patient should hear sounds equally in both ears. W ith conductive hearing loss, sound lateralizes (localizes) to the ear with the poorest hearing. W ith sensorineural loss, sound lateralizes to the better functioning ear . THE NOSE As air travels between the septum and the turbinates, it touches sensory hairs (cilia) in the mucosal surface, which then add, retain, or remove moisture and particles in the air to ensure delivery of humid, bacteria-free air to the pharynx and lungs. In addition, when air touches the mucosal cilia, the resultant stimulation of the first cranial nerve sends nerve impulses to the olfactory area of the frontal cortex, providing the sense of smell. ASSESSMENTCheck the external nose for redness, edema, masses, or poor alignment. Marked septal cartilage depression may indicate saddle deformity because of septa l destruction from trauma or congenital syphilis; extreme lateral deviation may result from injur y. Red nostrils may indicate frequent nose blowing caused by allergies or infectious rhinitis. Dilated, engor ged blood vessels may suggest alcoholism or constant exposure to the elements. A bulbous, discolored nose may be a sign of rosacea. With a nasal speculum and adequate lighting, check nasal mucosa for pallor and edema or redness and inflammation, dried mucous plugs, furuncles, and polyps. Also, look for abnormal appearance of the capillaries, boggy turbinates, and a deviated or perforated septum. Check for nasal dischar ge (assess color , consistency , and odor) and blood. Profuse, thin, watery dischar ge may indicate allergy or cold; excessive, thin, purulent dischar ge may indicate cold or chronic sinus infection. Check for sinus inflammation by applying pressure to the nostri ls, orbital rims, and cheeks. Pain after pressure applied above the upper orbital rims indicates frontal sinus irritation ; pain after pressure applied to the cheeks, maxillary sinus irritation. THE THROA T Parts of the throat include the pharynx, epiglottis, and larynx. The pharynx is the passagew ay for food to the esophagus and air to the larynx. The epiglottis (the lid of the larynx) diverts material away from  the glottis during swallowing. The larynx  produces sounds by vibrating expired air through the vocal cords. Changes in vocal cord length and air pressure affect pitch and voice intensity . The larynx also stimulates the vital cough reflex when a foreign body touches its sensitive mucosa. ASSESSMENT Using a bright light and a tongue blade, inspect the patient’ s mouth and throat. Look for inflammation or white patches, and any irregularities on the tongue or throat. Make sure the patient’ s airway isn’t compromi sed and also assess vital signs. Watch for and immediately report signs of respiratory distress (dyspnea, tachycardia, tachypnea, inspiratory stridor , restlessness, and nasal flaring) and changes in voice or in skin color , such as circumoral or nail bed cyan osis. Assess symmetry of the tongue as well as function ofthe soft palate. The main diagnostic test used in throat assessment is a culture to identify the infective or ganism. External Ear OTITIS EXTERNA Otitis externa, inflammation of the skin of the external ear canal and auricle, may be acute or chronic. Also known as external otitis  and swimmer ’s ear, it’s most common in the summer . With treatment, acute otitis externa usually subsides within 7 days—although it may become chronic—and tends to recur . Causes and Incidence Otitis externa usually results from bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococ ci and, sometimes, from fungi, such as Asper gillus niger  and Candida albicans  (fungal otitis externa is most common in tropical regions). Occasionally , chronic otitis externa results from dermatologic conditions, such as seborrhea or psoriasis. Aller gic reactions stemming from nickel or chromium earrings, chemicals in hair spray , cosmetics, hearing aids, and medications (such as sulfonamide and neomycin, which is comm only used to treat otitis extern a) can also cause otitis externa. Predisposing factors include: Swimming in contaminated water . (Cerumen creates a culture medium for the waterborne or ganism.) Cleaning the ear canal with a cotton swab, bobby pin, finger , or other foreign object. (This irritates the ear canal and, possibly , introduces the infecting microor ganism.) Exposure to dust or hair -care products (such as hair spray or other irritants), which causes the patient to scratch the ear , excoriating the auricle and canal. Regular use of earphones, earplugs, or earmuf fs, which trap moisture in the ear canal, creating a culture medium for infection (especially if earplugs don’ t fit properly). Chronic drainage from a perforated tympanic membrane.Perfumes or self-administered eardrops. Pathophysiology Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial or fungal overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local traum a. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized derm atologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, dischar ge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solut ion is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopi cal is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocom promised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis. Complications Complete closure of the ear canal Significant hearing loss Otitis media Cellulitis Abscesses Stenosis Signs and Symptoms Acute otitis externa characteristically produces moderate to severe pain that’s exacerbated by manipulating the auricle or tragus, clenching the teeth, opening the mouth, or chewing.  Its other clinical effects may include fever , foul-smelling dischar ge, crusting in the external ear, regional cellulitis, partial hearing loss, and itching. It’s usually difficult to view the tympanic membrane because of pain in the external canal. Hearing acuity is normal unless complete occlusion has occurred. Fungal otitis externa may be asymptomatic, although A. niger  produces a black or gray, blotting, paper -like growth in the ear canal. In chronic otitis externa, pruritus replaces pain, and scratching may lead to scaling and skin thickening. Aural dischar ge may also occur .Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS  Physical examination confirms otitis externa. In acute otitis externa, otoscopy r eveals a swollen external ear canal (sometimes to the point of complete closur e), pr eauricular lymphadenopathy (tender nodes anterior to the tragus, posterior to the ear , or in the upper neck), and, occasionally , regional cellulitis. In fungal otitis externa, removal of the growth reveals thick red epithelium. Microscopic examination or culture and sensitivity tests can identify the causative organism and determine antibiotic treatm ent. Pain on palpation of the tragus or auricle distinguishes acute otitis externa from acute otitis media. (See Differ entiating acute otitis externa from acute otitis media , page 629.) Differ entiating Acute Otitis Externa From Acute Otitis Media Use the assessment findings shown below to help differentiate acute otitis externa from acute otitis media. Acute Otitis Externa (Occurs Primarily In Summer) Acute Otitis Media (Occurs Primarily In Winter) In chronic otitis externa, physical examination reveals thick red epithelium in the ear canal. Severe chronic otitis externa may reflect underlying diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or nephritis. Microscopic examination or culture and sensitivity tests can identify the causative organism and help in the determination of antibiotic treatment. Treatment To relieve the pain of acute otitis externa, treatment includes heat therapy to the preauricular region (heat lamp; hot, damp compresses; or a heating pad), aspirin or acetaminophen, and codeine. Instillation of antibiotic eardrops (with or without  hydrocortisone ) follows cleaning of the ear and removal of debris. However , a corticosteroid helps reduce the inflammatory response. If fever persists  or regional cellulitis or tender postauricular adenopathy develops, a systemic antibiotic is necessary . If the ear canal is too edematou s for the instillation of eardrops, an ear wick may be used for the first few days. Topical treatme nt is generally required for otitis externa, as systemic antibiotics alone aren’ t sufficient. Analgesics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be required temporarily . As with other forms of this disorder , fungal otitis externa necessitates careful cleaning of the ear. Application of a keratolytic or 2% salicylic acid in cream-contai ning nystatin may help treat otitis externa resulting from candidal organisms. Instillation of slightly acidic eardrops creates an unfavorable environment in the ear canal for most fungi as well as Pseudomonas . No specific treatment exists for otitis externa caused by A. niger , except repeated cleaning of the ear canal with baby oil. In chronic otitis externa, prima ry treatment consists of cleaning the ear and removing debris. Supplemental therapy includes instillation of antibiotic eardrops or application of antibiotic ointment or cream (neomycin, bacitracin, or polymyxin B, possibly combined with hydrocortisone). Another ointment contains phenol, salicylic acid, precipitated sulfur , and petroleum jelly and produces exfoliative and antipruritic ef fects.For mild chronic otitis externa, treatment may include instillation of antibiotic eardrops once or twice weekly and wearing of specially fitted earplugs while the patient is showering, shampooing, or swimming. Special Considerations If the patient has acute otitis externa: The patient shouldn’ t participate in any swimming activity . Have the patient return to the clinic in 1 week for evaluation of the tympanic membrane to make sure it’ s intact. Monitor vital signs, particularly temperature. W atch for and record the type and amount of aural drainage. Remove debris and gently clean the ear canal with mild Burow solution (aluminum acetate). Place a wisp of cotton soaked with solution into the ear, and apply a saturated compress directly to the auricle. Afterward, dry the ear gently but thoroughly . (In severe otitis externa, such cleaning may be delayed until after initial treatment with antibiotic eardrops.) To instill eardrops in an adult, grasp the helix and pull upward and backward to straighten the canal. Tell the patient to notify the physician if they develop an aller gic reaction to the antibiotic drops or ointment, which may be indicated by increased swelling and discomfort of the area and worsening of other symptoms. PEDIA TRIC TIP  To instill ear drops in a child, pull the earlobe downwar d and backwar d. To ensur e that the dr ops r each the epithelium, insert a wisp of cotton moistened with ear drops. If the patient has chronic otitis externa, clean the ear thoroughly . Use wet soaks intermittently on oozing or infected skin. If the patient has a chronic fungal infection, clean the ear canal well, and then apply an exfoliative ointment. Urge prompt treatment for otitis media to prevent perforation of the tympanic membrane. (See Preventing otitis externa .) PREVENTION   PREVENTING OTITIS EXTERNA Any patient who has experienced otitis externa should be taught to prevent a recurrence by avoiding irritants, such as hair-care products and earrings, and by avoiding cleaning the ears with cotton- tipped applicato rs or other objects. Encourage the patient to keep water out of the ears when showering or shampooing by using lamb’ s wool earplugs, coated with petroleum  jelly. Also, parents of young children should be told that modeling clay makes a tight seal to prevent water from getting into the external ear canal. In addition, when the patient goes swimming, keep their head above water or wear earplugs. After swimming, the patient should instill one or two drops of a mixture that is one-half 70% alcohol and one-half white vinegar to toughen the skin of the external ear canal. ELDER TIP  If the patient is an elderly person or has diabetes, evaluate for malignant otitis externa. PEDIA TRIC TIP  Childr en who have an intact tympanic membrane but are predisposed to otitis externa fr om swimming should instill two to thr ee drops of a 1:1 solution of white vinegar and 70% ethyl alcohol into their ears befor e and after swimming. BENIGN TUMORS OF THE EAR CANAL Benign tumors may develop anywhere in the ear canal. Common types include keloids, osteomas, and sebaceous cysts; their causes vary. (See Causes and characteristics of benign ear tumors .) These tumors seldom become malignant; with proper treatment, the prognosis is excellent. Causes and Characteristics of Benign Ear T umors Tumor Causes and incidence Characteristics Tumor Causes and incidence Characteristics Keloid Surgery or trauma such as ear piercing Most common in blacksHypertrophy and fibrosis of scar tissue Commonly recurs Osteoma Idiopathic growth Predisposing factor: swimming in cold water Three times more common in males than in females Seldom occurs before adolescenceBony outgrowth from wall of external auditory meatus Usually bilateral and multiple (exostoses) May be circumscribed or dif fuse, nondisplaceable, nontender Sebaceous cystObstruction of a sebaceous glandPainless, circumscribed, round mass of variable size filled with oily , fatty , glandular secretions May occur on external ear and outer third of external auditory canal Signs and Symptoms A benig n ear tumor is usually asymptomatic, unless it becomes  infected, in which case pain, fever , or inflammation may result. (Pain is usually a sign of a malignant tumor .) If the tumor grows large enough to obstruct the ear canal by itself or through accumulated cerumen and debris, it may cause hearing loss and the sensation of pressure. Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS  Clinical featur es and patient history suggest a benign tumor of the ear canal; otoscopy confirms it. T o rule out cancer , a biopsy may be necessary . Treatment Generally , a benign tumor requires surgical excision if it obstr ucts the ear canal, is cosmetically undesirable, or becomes malignant. Treatment for keloids may include surgery followed by repeated injections of long-acting steroids into the suture line. Excision must be complete, but even this may not prevent recurrence. Surgical excision of an osteoma consists of elevating the skin from the surface of the bony growth and shaving the osteoma with a mechanical burr or drill.Before surgery, a sebaceous cyst requires preliminary treatment with antibiotics, to reduce inflammation. To prevent recurrence, excis ion must be complete, including the sac or capsule of the cyst. Special Considerations Because treatment for benign ear tumors generally doesn’ t require hospitalization, focus care on emotional support and on providing appropriate patient education so that the patient follows the therapeutic plan properly when he’ s at home. Thoroughly explain diagnostic procedures and treatment to the patient and family . Reassure them and answer any questions they may have. After sur gery, instruct the patient in good aural hygiene. Until the ear is completely healed, advise the patient not to insert anything into their ear or allow water to get into it. Suggest that they cover their ears with a cap when showering. Teach the patient how to recognize signs of infection, such as pain, fever , localized redness, and swelling. If the patient detects any of these signs, instruct to report them immediately . Middle Ear OTITIS MEDIA Otitis media, inflammation of the middle ear, may be suppurative or secretory , acute, persistent, unresponsive, or chronic. With prompt treatment, the prognosis for acute otitis media is excellent; however , prolonged accumulation of fluid within the middle ear cavity causes chronic otitis media and, possibly , perforation of the tympanic membrane. (See Site of otitis media .) Site of Otitis Media The common site of otitis media is shown below . Chronic suppura tive otitis media may lead to scarring, adhes ions, and severe structural or functional ear damage. Chronic secretory otitis media, with its persistent inflammation and pressure, may cause conductive hearing loss. Recurrent otitis media is defined as three near-acute otitis media episodes within 6 months or four episodes of acute otitis media within 1 year . Otitis media with complications involves damage to middle ear structures (such as adhesions, retraction, pockets, cholesteatoma, and intratemporal and intracranial complications). Causes and Incidence Otitis media results from disruption of eustachian tube patency . In the suppurative form, respiratory tract infection, allergic reaction, nasotracheal intubation, or positional changes allow nasopharyngeal flora to refluxthrough the eustachian tube and colonize the middle ear. Suppurative otitis media usually results from bacterial infection with pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae  (the most common cause in children younger than age 6), Moraxella catarr halis , beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci (most common cause in children age 6 or older), or gram-negative bacteria. Predisposing factors include the normally wider , shorter , more horizontal eustachian tubes and increased  lymphoid tissue in children, as well as anatomic anomalies. Chronic suppurative otitis media results from inadequate treatment for acute otitis episodes or from infection by resistant strains of bacteria or , rarely , tuberculosis. Secretory otitis media results from obstruction of the eustachian tube. This causes a buildup of negativ e pressure in the middle ear that promotes transudation of sterile serous fluid from blood vessels in the membrane of the middle ear. Such effusion may be secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction from  viral infection or allergy. It may also follow barotrauma (pressure injury  caused by the inability to equalize pressures between the environment and the middle ear), as occurs during rapid aircraft descent in a person with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or during rapid underwater ascent in scuba diving (barotitis media). Chronic secretory otitis media follows persistent eustach ian tube dysfunction from mechanical obstruction (adenoidal tissue overgrowth or tumors), edema (aller gic rhinitis or chronic sinus infection), or inadequate treatment for acute suppurative otitis media. Acute otitis media is common in children; its incidence rises during the winter months, paralleling the seasonal rise in nonbacterial respiratory tract infections. Chronic secretory otitis media most commonly occurs in children with tympanostomy tubes or those with a perforated tympanic membrane. Pathophysiology Acute otitis media is an acute infection of the middle ear, usually lasting less than 6 weeks. The primary cause of acute otitis media is usually Streptococcus pneumoniae , H. influenzae , and M. catarr halis , which enter the middle ear after eustachia n tube dysfunction caused by obstruction related to upper respiratory infections, inflammation of surrounding structures (e.g., sinusitis, adenoid hypertrophy), or allergic reactions (e.g., allergic rhinitis). Bacteria can enter the eustachian tube from contaminatedsecretions in the nasopharynx  and the middle ear from a tympanic membrane perfo ration. A purulent exudate is usually present in the middle ear, resulting in a conductive hearing loss. Complications Spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane Persistent perforation Chronic otitis media Mastoiditis Abscesses Vertigo Permanent hearing loss Signs and Symptoms Clinical features of acute suppurative otitis media include severe, deep, throbbing pain (from pressure behind the tympanic membrane); signs of URTI (sneezing or coughing); mild to very high fever; hearing loss (usually mild and conductive); tinnitus; dizziness; nausea; and vomiting. Other possible effects include bulging of the tympanic membrane, with concomitant erythema, and purulent drainage in the ear canal from tympanic membrane rupture. However , many patients are asymptomatic. Acute secretory otitis media produces a severe conductive hearing loss— which varies from 15 to 35 dB, depending on the thickness and amount of fluid in the middle ear cavity—and, possibly , a sensation of fullness in the ear and popping, crackling, or clicking sounds on swallowing or with jaw movement. Accumulation of fluid may also cause the patient  to hear an echo when the patient speaks and to experience a vague feeling of top- heaviness. The cumulative effects of chronic otitis media include thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent tympanic membrane mobility , cholesteatoma (a cystlike mass in the midd le ear), and, in chronic suppurative otitis media, a painless, purulent dischar ge. The extent of associa ted conductive hearing loss varies with the size and type of tympanic membrane perforation and ossicular destruction. If the tympanic membrane has ruptured, the patient may state that the pain has suddenly stopped. Complications may include abscesses (brain, subperiosteal, and epidural), sigmoid sinus or jugular vein thrombosis,septicemia, meningitis, suppurative labyrinthitis, facial paralysis, and otitis externa. PEDIA TRIC TIP  The following factors incr ease a child’ s risk of developing otitis media: acute otitis media in the first year after birth (r ecurr ent otitis media) day car e family history of middle ear disease formula feeding male gender sibling history of otitis media smoking in the household Acute otitis media may not produce any symptoms in the first few months of life; irritability may be the only indication of earache. Diagnosis In acute suppurative otitis media, otoscopy reveals obscured or distorted bony landmarks of the tympanic membrane. Pneumatoscopy can show decreased tympa nic membrane mobility , but this procedure is painful with an obviously bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane. The pain pattern is diagnostically significant: For example, in acute suppurative otitis media, pulling the auric le doesn’ t exacerbate the pain. A culture of the ear drainage identifies the causative or ganism. In acute secretory otitis media, otoscopic examination reveals tympanic membrane retraction, which causes the bony landmarks to appear more prominent. Examination also detects clear or amber fluid behind the tympanic membrane. If hemorrhage into the middle ear has occurred, as in barotrauma, the tympanic membrane appears blue-black. In chronic otitis media, patient history discloses recurrent or unresolved otitis media. Otoscopy show s thickening, sometimes scarring, and decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane; pneumatoscopy shows decreased or absent tympanic membrane movement. A history of recent air travel or scuba diving suggests barotitis media.Tympanocentesis for microbiologic diagnosis is recommended for treatment failures and may be followed by myringotomy . Tympanometry , acoustic reflex measurement, or acoustic reflexometry may be needed to document the presence of fluid in the middle ear. White blood cell count is higher in bacter ial otitis media than in sterile otitis media. Mastoid X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scan of the head or mastoids may show the spreading of the infection beyond the middle ear . Treatment In acute suppurative otitis media, antibiotic therapy includes amoxicillin. In areas with a high incidence of beta-lactamase–producing H. influenzae  and in patients who aren’ t responding to ampicillin or amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassiu m may be used. For those who are allergic to penicillin derivatives, therapy  may include cefaclor or trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Severe, painful bulging of the tympanic  membrane usually necessit ates myringoto my. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can help prevent acute suppurative otitis media in high-risk patients. A single dose of ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg is effective against major pathogens but is expensive and is reserved for very sick infants. In the patient with recurring otitis media, antibiotic s must be used with discretion to prevent the development of resistant strains of bacteria. In acute  secretory otitis media, inflation of the eustachian tube using Valsalva maneuver several times a day may be the only treatment required. Otherwise, nasopharyngeal decongestant therapy may be helpful. It should continue for at least 2 weeks and, sometimes, indefinitely , with periodic evaluation. If decongestant therapy fails, myringotomy and aspiration of middle ear fluid  are necessary , followed by insertion of a polyethylene tube into the tympanic membrane, for immediate and prolonged equalization of pressure. The tube falls out spontaneously after 9 to 12 months. Concomitant treatment for the underlying cause (such as elimination of allergens, or adenoidectomy for hypertrophied adenoids) may also be helpful in correcting this disorder . Treatment for chronic otitis media includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium or cefuroxime, for exacerbations of acute otitis media; elimination of eustachian tube obstruction; treatment for otitis externa; myringoplasty and tympanoplasty to reconstruct middleear structures when thickening  and scarring are present; and, possibly , mastoidectomy . Cholesteatoma requires excision. Special Considerations Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures. After myringotomy , change the cotton whenever it gets damp, fever"
